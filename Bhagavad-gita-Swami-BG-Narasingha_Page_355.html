<p>Byam CHAPTER 13 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>They ate without a first cause because they are Saktis, or</p>
<p>potencies of the Absolute Truth who is Himself without</p>
<p>origin. In other words, the cause of all causes is Sti Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus, He is known as sarva~karana-karanam.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Though material nature and the living beings are eter-</p>
<p>nal and without beginning, they nonetheless have distinctly</p>
<p>different qualities and characteristics. They are not the</p>
<p>same. Material nature is described as the body, senses and</p>
<p>other elements as well as the transformations of qualities</p>
<p>such as happiness, distress, lamentation and illusion. The</p>
<p>living beings are patt and parcel of the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>They ate sac-cid-ananda — having the constitution of eter-</p>
<p>nity, knowledge and bliss. When the iving eings identify</p>
<p>the self as the material body, they saffer ander the miser-</p>
<p>ies of happiness and distress and perpetually transmigrate</p>
<p>from one body to the next in the cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the greatest questions in life, namely, “Where</p>
<p></p>
<p>do we come from?” is certainly answered in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet the use of the word anadi in verse 20 has encouraged</p>
<p></p>
<p>some thinkers to conclude that the living beings have</p>
<p></p>
<p>always been in the material world. In other words, that</p>
<p></p>
<p>although the living beings ate eternal, they begin in the</p>
<p></p>
<p>material universe and have always been in the material</p>
<p>universe. This conclusion however is not supported by</p>
<p>ptevious aciryas of the Bhagavad-gita such as Vigvanatha</p>
<p>Caktavarti, Baladeva Vidyabhiisana and others. To them,</p>
<p></p>
<p>anadi means beginningless, before time began.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the living beings and their</p>
<p>beginning as anadi, the Vaismava acarya Svami B. R.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stidhara Maharaja says as follows:</p>
