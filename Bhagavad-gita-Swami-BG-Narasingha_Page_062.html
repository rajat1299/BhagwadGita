<p>death. At death, consciousness transfers to another body</p>
<p>according to the laws of material nature (karma) and begins</p>
<p>the cycle yet again. The ever-changing body never bewil-</p>
<p>ders those who 31८ cognisant of the difference between the</p>
<p>material body and consciousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Embodied consciousness is said to have five stages</p>
<p>known as the pafica~kosa — annamaya (satisfying out exist-</p>
<p>ence by eating, as seen in children), pranamaya (conscious-</p>
<p>ness of the preservation of one’s body), manomaya (the</p>
<p>stage of mental awareness), vijflanamaya (the cultivation of</p>
<p>consciousness based on higher knowledge, understanding</p>
<p>one is not this material body) and anandamaya (cultivating</p>
<p>and enteting into one’s relationship with the Supreme as</p>
<p>part and parcel of Krsna). The first three stages, annamaya,</p>
<p>pranamaya and manomaya pertain to all living beings that</p>
<p>are caught in the doldrums of material sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Vijfianamaya and anandamaya concerns those who have</p>
<p>acquired knowledge of self-realisation (vijfiana) and per-</p>
<p>fection (ananda).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who are asleep, simply absorbed in bodily iden-</p>
<p>tification, never experience the world beyond their sense</p>
<p>perception. Heat and cold, happiness and distress, pleasure</p>
<p>and pain, birth and death — these are the perceptions of life</p>
<p>experienced by those with no knowledge of consciousness.</p>
<p>But those who are liberated from the bodily concept of life</p>
<p>are awake in the conscious world and are always in balance,</p>
<p>even in the face of opposing and contradictory situations</p>
<p>in the material world. They are undisturbed.</p>
