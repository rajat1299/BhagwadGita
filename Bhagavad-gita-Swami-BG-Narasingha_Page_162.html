<p>Karma~yoga (bhakti-yoga) on the other hand, is easily</p>
<p>adoptable by anyone at any stage and leads quickly to the</p>
<p>ultimate goal of life. In karma~yoga one performs devo-</p>
<p>tional activities and follows basic principles of purity such</p>
<p>as no intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling and no eating</p>
<p>of meat, fish ot eggs. These principles can be easi Ly adopted</p>
<p>by anyone. Similarly, the devotional activity of chanting</p>

<p>others, according to the desires of Krsna, then such a san-</p>
<p>nyast becomes most perfect and is naturally accepted as the</p>
<p></p>
<p>gara or teacher of both paths.</p>
