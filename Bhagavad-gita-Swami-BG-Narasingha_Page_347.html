<p>Byam CHAPTER 13 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>and firm devotion unto Me, dwelling ina solitary place,</p>
<p>free from the desire to socialise with the masses, constant</p>
<p>determination in achieving self-realisation and a desire to</p>
<p>gain knowledge of the Absolute Truth — all these qualities</p>
<p>have been declared to be knowledge. Anything contrary to</p>
<p></p>
<p>this is ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here, the greater wealth of knowledge y which a human</p>
<p>being can achieve the perfection of life has been described.</p>
<p>This detailed explanation by Sti Krsna leads one to an undet-</p>
<p>standing that promotes self-realisation and frees one from</p>
<p>ignorance. Unfortunately, this knowledge is completely</p>
<p>lacking in modern societies, both eastern and western. All</p>
<p>contemporary fields of knowledge Le. iology, physics, math-</p>
<p>ematics and philosophy lead one to accept the body as the</p>
<p></p>
<p>self and to accept grati fication of one’s mind, intelligence,</p>
<p>ego and senses as the goal of life. Such an understanding is</p>
<p>utterly devoid of the real purpose of life, considering that this</p>
<p></p>
<p>one life is the all in all and that after death there is nothing.</p>
<p>The material world is a place of birth, death, old age</p>
<p></p>
<p>and disease and is sometimes referred to as mrtyu-loka or</p>
<p></p>
<p>the planet of death. Birth, death, old age and disease are</p>
<p></p>
<p>indeed the real problems facing all living beings regardless</p>
<p></p>
<p>of race, nationa ity ot belief. Any knowledge that does not</p>
<p></p>
<p>aim to put an end to these miseries is certainly incomplete</p>
<p></p>
<p>at best. There are, of course, medicines, drugs, sutgery and</p>
<p>medical machines to ease the pain of birth, slow the old</p>
<p>age process, cure some diseases and prolong the process of</p>
<p>dying, but these are only stopgaps or temporary solutions.</p>
<p>One should recognise these problems of life and be</p>
<p></p>
<p>inquisitive as to where the real solution is to be found.</p>
