<p>अ CHAPTER2 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 44</p>
<p>भोगेश्वर्मपरसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम्‌ ।</p>
<p>व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ नविधीयते Nee |</p>

<p>vyavasayatmika buddhib samadbau na vidbiyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>By such ideas these persons, contemplating sense gratifica-</p>
<p>tion and mundane pleasures, do not attain the resolve to fix</p>
<p>their minds on the Supreme.</p>

<p>The greatest fear that is mentioned in the above verse</p>
<p>is the fear of losing the haman form of life and taking</p>
<p>birth in an animal body or lower. Some people think of</p>
<p>the consciousness that is generally called atma as being</p>
<p>human and other atmas as being animal etc. But in reality</p>
<p>no such distinction between a human atma and an animal</p>
<p>atma exists. One transmigrates, according to one’s karma,</p>
<p>through many lower species of life and eventually arrives</p>
<p>at the human stage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Human life offers one the opportunity of self-reali-</p>
<p>sation ot the chance to cultivate spiritual knowledge and</p>
<p>awareness. One who attempts to become self-realised is</p>
<p>not always successful in one attempt or in one lifetime.</p>
<p>However, Sti Krsna gives us the assurance that even a</p>
<p>little endeavour on the path of self-realisation will save</p>
<p>us from the greatest fear, namely that of taking birth in a</p>
<p>lower life form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The perfection of self-realisation in the yoga system</p>
<p>is called samadbi, or the complete absorption of our con-</p>
<p>sciousness in the Supreme. The student of bhakti-yoga</p>
<p></p>
<p>achieves such a state of self-realisation by following the</p>
