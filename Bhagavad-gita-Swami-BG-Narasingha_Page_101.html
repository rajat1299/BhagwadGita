<p>moment because in the material world everyone is forced</p>
<p>to act under the influence of the modes of nature. It is also</p>
<p>said that the pure nature of the atma is to be engaged in</p>
<p>the spititual activities of serving the Supreme Being, Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, all activities are to be connected to, and for the</p>
<p>satisfaction of Visnu/Krsna. This is known as the consti-</p>
<p>tutional position of the atma.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt is clear from the above verses that action is better</p>
<p>than inaction. As it is said, “An idle mind is the Devil’s</p>
<p>workshop.” If the senses are idle and one tries to empty</p>
<p>the mind, then what usually transpires is that the mind</p>
<p>becomes engaged in unproductive thoughts and eventually</p>
<p>the sense-objects carry the mind and senses away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The influence of the modes of material nature over the</p>
<p>atma is called méaya, or illusion. This maya 1s the external</p>
<p>enetgy of the Absolute Truth. When the znd is separated,</p>
<p>ot disconnected from the Absolute Truth by improper</p>
<p>philosophical understanding or improper activities, the</p>
<p>result is bewilderment, confusion and sarits@ra.</p>

<p>VERSE 10</p>
<p>सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः FAT पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।</p>

<p>anena prasavisyadbvam esa vo'stv ista kamadbuk</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the beginning of creation, Brahma created mankind</p>
<p>along with the system of sacrifice and said, “Through this</p>
<p>sacrifice may you prosper. May it fulfil all your desires.”</p>
