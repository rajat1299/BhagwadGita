<p>This means that non-vegetarian foodstuff such as meat,</p>
<p>fish and eggs, as well as preparations containing sach</p>
<p>things are not offerable to Krsna. Food offerable to Krsna</p>
<p>includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains and milk products.</p>
<p>It should be noted that being Gopala, the protector of the</p>
<p>cows, Krsna is very fond of milk products such as yogutt,</p>
<p>butter etc. A diet of sach food offered to Krsna will make</p>
<p>one healthy and fit for the ॥ of yoga as well as free</p>
<p></p>
<p>from karmic reactions.</p>

<p>sadbur eva sa mantavyab samyag vyavasito hi sab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even if one is impious and has committed abominable</p>
<p>acts, if he worships Me with one-pointed devotion, such</p>
<p>a person should be considered saintly because his deter-</p>
<p>mination is perfect.</p>
