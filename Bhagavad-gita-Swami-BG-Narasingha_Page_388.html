<p>position in the Supreme Abode. Such persons are known</p>
<p>as “Fall-vadis’. According to the thinking of the ‘Fall-</p>
<p>vadis’, the Supreme Abode is fallible and subject to envy,</p>
<p>dissatisfaction, greed, hate and so on. The word ‘fallible’</p>
<p>comes from the Latin word fallere that means ‘to deceive’.</p>
<p>In order to deceive there must be ignorance, forgetfulness</p>
<p>and suspicion etc. However, considering that no material</p>
<p>qualities exist in the Supreme Abode, it is not possible for</p>
<p>any liberated living being there to become contaminated</p>
<p>by material qualities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says that once going to that abode one never</p>
<p>returns to the material world (vad gatva na nivartante).</p>
<p>Kysna does not say that going again to that Supreme Abode</p>
<p>one never returns. Therefore, it is understood by Krsna’s</p>
<p>own words that no one falls from the Supreme Abode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All living beings in the spiritual and material worlds are</p>
<p>eternally Krsna’s parts and particles — mamaivarnso jiva-</p>
<p>loke jiva-bbittab sanatanab. However, the living beings who</p>
<p>ate conditioned by material nature and who have no con-</p>
<p>trol of their senses or knowledge of the Supreme Abode,</p>
<p>ate again and again reborn within the world of birth and</p>
<p>death. At the time of death they are carried away to their</p>
<p>next body by material desires and the mind, just as a fta-</p>
<p></p>
<p>gtance is carried by the wind.</p>
