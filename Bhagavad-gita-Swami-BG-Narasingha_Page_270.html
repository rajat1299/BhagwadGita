<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>

<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna is unknown and unknowable. He 15 adboksaja</p>
<p>— beyond the reach of the senses, beyond the comprehen-</p>
<p>sion of the mind and intelligence. No amount of ascending</p>
<p>endeavours on the part of the living beings can reach Krsna,</p>
<p>but in an instant He can descend to reveal Himself. Though</p>
<p>Krsna is their origin, not even the demigods and the great</p>
<p>sages such as Brahma, Indta, Sanaka, Durvasa, Marici and</p>
<p>others know Krsna as He is. But one who 15 Krsna’s dev-</p>
<p>०६९९, the bhakti-yogi, knows Krsna as the Supreme Person</p>
<p>situated in the core of his heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>sa vai purhsarh paro dharmo yato bhaktir adboksaje</p>
<p>abaituky-apratibata yayatma suprasidati</p>
<p></p>
<p>The topmost dharma for mankind is that by which</p>
<p>they can attain devotion unto the Supreme Petson,</p>
<p>who is adboksaja and who cannot be known by the</p>
<p>material senses. Such bhakti-~yoga must be unmo-</p>
<p>tivated and uninterrupted to fully satisfy the self.</p>
<p>(Srimad Bhagavatam 1.2.6)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna gives birth to creation and to all things, but He</p>
<p>Himself is without birth. Still, when Krsna appears on</p>
<p>Earth, as He did some 5,000 years ago to speak Bhaga-</p>
<p>vad-gita, He accepts His devotees Vasudeva and Devaki</p>
<p>as His parents and appears as the sun seems to manifest</p>
<p>from the ocean at the beginning of each day. Krsna first</p>
<p>revealed Himself in the heart of Vasudeva and then trans-</p>
<p>ferred Himself to the heart of Devaki. From there He</p>
<p>appeared from het heart into the world. It is inconceivable,</p>
<p>but Krsna appears in the world without taking birth.</p>
