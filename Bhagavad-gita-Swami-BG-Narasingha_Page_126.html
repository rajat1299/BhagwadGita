<p>1 am again teaching this ancient science of yoga to you.</p>
<p>Because you are My dear friend and devotee you can under-</p>
<p>stand the transcendental mystery of which I speak.</p>

<p>VERSE 4</p>
<p>aA उवाच |</p>
<p>अपरं भवतो जन्म परं जन्म विवस्वतः।</p>
<p>कथमेतद्विजानीयां त्वमादौ मोक्तवानिति ॥४॥</p>

<p>arjuna uvaca —</p>
<p>apararh bhavato janma pararh janma vivasvatab</p>

<p>Arjuna said: You were born only recently and the sun-</p>
<p>god appeared long ago. So how am I to understand that</p>
<p>in ancient times You had. taught him the science of yoga?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrtti</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the above statement of Sti Krsna, the</p>
<p>Bhagavad -gita is a very ancient text. Krsna says that previ-</p>
<p>ously He had spoken this knowledge of yoga to Vivasvan,</p>
<p>the predominating deity of the sun planet, and in turn</p>
<p>Vivasvan passed on this knowledge to other universal lead-</p>
<p>ers and great kings. This flow of knowledge from one to</p>
<p>another is called parampara or disciplic succession. But in</p>
<p>time, the knowledge of yoga was lost and therefore Krsna</p>
<p>was again speaking Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The qualifications to properly understand Bhagavad-gita</p>
<p>ate stated here. One should be a devotee of Krsna and one</p>
<p>should understand that Krsna is subrdam-sarva-bbatanam,</p>
<p>the friend of all living beings. In bhakti-yoga one does not</p>
<p>fear God because Krsna is not a wrathful God. Krsna is</p>
<p></p>
<p>our dear-most friend and our ever well-wisher. Krsna is the</p>
