<p>The inability to discriminate between proper and</p>
<p>improper actions is the first recognisable characteristic of</p>
<p>an asura. Additionally, Sti Krsna says, they do not know</p>
<p>what is purity, proper behaviour ot truthfulness. Trath-</p>
<p>fulness, cleanliness, austerity and metcy are most desirable</p>
<p>qualities for a human being, but these are totally lacking in</p>
<p>one who has acquired the nature of an asura.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna continues to describe in detail the qualities</p>
<p>and characteristics of the aswra mentality and if one takes</p>
<p></p>
<p>careful note of what Krsna is saying, then one is faced with</p>
<p></p>
<p>the stark realisation that the world we live in today is dom-</p>
<p>inated by the thinking and activities of the asuras.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The structure of our world is now based on rampant</p>
<p>consumerism, the ‘shop till you drop’ mentality. Enjoy,</p>
<p>enjoy, enjoy! The ‘if it feels good, do it’ mentality is every-</p>
<p>where. We ate led to believe that there is no ultimate reality,</p>
<p>that this one life is the all in all, and therefore we should</p>
<p>enjoy it while it lasts — the fulfilment of the sexual lust of</p>
<p>men and women being at the forefront of such enjoyment.</p>
<p>The epitome of this is represented worldwide by the casual</p>
<p>and legal acceptance of contraception and abortion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the present mentality of the human being, it seems</p>
<p>that the world is set on a path of destruction — with dev-</p>
<p>astation of the environment, economic collapse, extinction</p>
<p>of species and even genocide of certain races of humans.</p>
<p>Have we no eyes to see what is happening? Has the human</p>
<p>race become so proud and arrogant of it’s achievements</p>
<p>that it has become blind?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Good government is essential in a civilised world. Such</p>
<p></p>
<p>a government is for the purpose of safeguarding society</p>
