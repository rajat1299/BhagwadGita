<p>forbidden in society and between nations. When such</p>
<p>aggression did occut, retaliation and wat were acceptable.</p>
<p>According to the great sage Vasistha, there are six types of</p>
<p>aggressors and according to Manu-sambita these aggressors</p>
<p>are to be met with lethal response.</p>
<p></p>
<p>agnido garadas caiva Sastra-panir dhanapabab</p>
<p>ksetra-darapabart ca sad ete hyatatayinab</p>
<p></p>
<p>The arsonist who sets fire to one’s house, one who</p>
<p>administers poison, one who attacks with deadly</p>
<p>weapons, one who usurps a nations resources, one</p>
<p>who invades and occupies a sovereign country and</p>
<p>one who kidnaps one’s family members - all should</p>
<p>be considered as aggressors. (Vasistha-smrti 3.19)</p>
<p></p>
<p>atatayinam ayantarh banyad evavicarayan</p>
<p>natatayi-vadhe doso bantur bhavati kaScana</p>

<p>(Manu-sambita 8.350)</p>
<p></p>
<p>These verses are according to the rules given in the laws</p>
<p>of society (artha-Sastra). Yet the laws of dharma (dhar-</p>
<p>ma-Ssastra), which are superior to the artha-Sastra, state</p>
<p>that one should never inflict harm on any living being (ma</p>
<p>birnsyat sarva-bbatani) — what to say of one’s family mem-</p>
<p>bets and superiors?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was Arjuna’s dilemma. Being a softhearted devo-</p>
<p>tee of Sti Kysna, Atjuna was disinclined to take up arms</p>
<p>against his family members, but being a watrior he had</p>
<p>to face his destiny. In this state of bewilderment, Arjana</p>
