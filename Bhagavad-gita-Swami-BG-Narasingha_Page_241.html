<p>purusab sa parab partha bhaktya labhyas tv-ananyaya</p>
<p></p>
<p>-yasyantab sthani bhutani yena sarvam idarh tatam</p>
<p></p>
<p>O Partha, that Supreme Person, within whom all living</p>
<p>beings are situated and who pervades the entire creation,</p>
<p></p>
<p>can only be attained by bhakti-yoga.</p>

<p>The topmost planet in the material universe is known as</p>
<p>Satya-loka, the abode of Brahma. Life on that planet is very</p>
<p>long — one day in Satya-loka is equal to 4,260,000,000</p>
<p>years on planet Earth. Nonetheless death occurs there also.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the material universe is free from death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of each of Brahma’s days there is a partial</p>
<p>annihilation in the universe and a total annihilation of the</p>
<p>universe at the end of Brahma’s life. The partial annihila-</p>
<p>tions ate called pralaya and the final annihilation is called</p>
<p>maba-pralaya. Everything in the universe has a beginning</p>
<p></p>
<p>and an end. Al things come into being and eventually</p>
<p>all things are destroyed. Creation, duration and annihila-</p>
<p>tion are the three basic phases of the universe, yet Bhaga-</p>
<p></p>
<p>vad-gita does not subsctibe to an apocalyptic world view</p>
<p>or an ‘end times’ scenario in which we will all be judged.</p>
<p>The predominating Deities of creation, duration and</p>
<p>annihilation are the three gundvataras, Brahma, Maha-</p>
<p>Visnu and Siva respectively. Brahma manifests the second-</p>
<p>ary cteation, Maha-Visnu maintains the creation and Siva,</p>
<p>by producing a sound vibration from his damaru drum,</p>
<p>brings about the annihilation. These gunavataras are por-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tions of the plenary expansions of Krsna, the avatari, or</p>
<p>origin of all avatiras. During the periods of annihilation,</p>
<p>both partial and complete, the living beings rest in a state</p>
