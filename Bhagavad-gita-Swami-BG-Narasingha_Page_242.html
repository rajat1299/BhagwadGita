<p>of slumber within the body of Maha-Visnu and are again</p>
<p>manifest at the arrival of Brahma’s day. This is repeated</p>
<p>over and over again on a cosmic timescale until Brahma</p>
<p>reaches the end of his life, at which point the entire universe</p>
<p>is again wound up in the body of Maha-Visnu. Everything</p>
<p>necessaty for the manifestation of the material universe,</p>
<p>and indeed billions and trillions of universes, is provided</p>
<p>by Maha-Visnu in the form of the mahat-tattva (the agere-</p>
<p>gate of material elements), and at the time of annihilation</p>
<p>that energy is again absorbed into Maha-Visnu.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Energy is neither created or destroyed as it exists</p>
<p>always as Krsna’s apara-prakrti, inferior material energy.</p>
<p>That energy is endlessly mutable, manifest and unman-</p>
<p>ifest, but ultimately it is never destroyed. Krsna and all</p>
<p>His energies are eternal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once again, the same point is being reiterated by</p>
<p>Krsna, that His Supreme Abode is beyond material</p>
<p>nature, eternally manifest, beyond bitth and death and</p>
<p>once going there one does not return to sarinsa@ra. That</p>
<p>Supreme Abode of Krsna is Goloka Vrndavana, and it is</p>
<p>attainable only through the process of bhakti-~yoga. This</p>
<p>Supreme Abode is mentioned in Brhad-bhagavatamrta as</p>
<p></p>
<p>follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>goloka-namopari Sarva-sitia—go</p>
<p>vaikunthato desa-viSesa-Sekharab</p>
<p>sa ca tad vraja-lokanarn Srimat-premanuvartina</p>
<p>krsne Suddbatarenaiva bhavenatkena labbyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>Far from this material universe is the beautiful abode</p>
<p>of Sti Krsna that is known as Goloka Vrndavana,</p>
<p>the topmost Vaikuntha planet. Goloka is only</p>
