<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>9) vanquisher of the enemy, those that lack faith in this</p>
<p>path of dharma can never attain Me and are forced to be</p>
<p>reborn in the continuous cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrttt</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now Sti Krsna will emphasise to Atjuna what He con-</p>
<p>siders to be the greatest secret, or gubya, of the yoga system,</p>
<p>so that any remaining doubt that Arjuna may still harbour</p>
<p>might be dispelled. This has already been mentioned in</p>
<p>previous chapters, but now Krsna will make it definitive.</p>
<p>Sti Krsna is the Absolute Trath, the Cause of creation,</p>
<p>the origin of all living beings, the Controller, the object of</p>
<p>knowledge, the mantra ort and so forth. One who knows</p>
<p>this in his heart of hearts and lives solely by such a creed</p>
<p>will surely attain Krsna. This is the positive incentive. The</p>
<p>negative incentive is also explained by Krsna that those</p>
<p>who are not fixed in Him will be reborn in the cycle of</p>
<p>birth and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse 3 Krsna uses the word agraddadbanab. Srad-</p>
<p>dba means ‘faith’ and asraddba means ‘without faith’. This</p>
<p>describes those who do not have the resolute determina-</p>
<p>tion to perform bhakti-yoga. Of such persons Krsna says</p>
<p>that they will continue in the cycle of sarisara. That is</p>
<p>not to say that they are damned to some eternal hell, bat</p>
<p>simply put, they cannot attain the platform of liberation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First it is nmportant to understand that sraddba is not</p>
<p>to be confused with the belief or mundane faith that is</p>
<p>usually associated with a particular religion such as Juda-</p>
<p>ism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism. Christian</p>
<p>faith, Muslim faith, Hindu faith etc. implies a belief in</p>
<p>a particular set of moral ideals, myths, superstitions and</p>
<p>dogmas, buat sraddba is something entirely different.</p>
