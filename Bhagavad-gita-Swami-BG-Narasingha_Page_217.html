<p>Bro CHAPTER] च्म</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether one is without desire or full of desire or</p>
<p>aspires for liberation — one should take shelter of</p>
<p>the Supreme Person through bhakti-yoga. (Srimad</p>
<p>Bhagavatam 2.3.10).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna further explains that pious persons (the dis-</p>
<p>tressed, the inquisitive, those seeking wealth and those</p>
<p>desiring self-realisation) take shelter of Him, but of these</p>
<p>Kysna says that those in search of knowledge and self-real-</p>
<p>isation ate superior.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After taking shelter of Sti Krsna for wealth, out of cari-</p>
<p>osity ot out of distress, it is often seen that such persons</p>
<p>again resume their normal course of material activities.</p>
<p>Those who come to Krsna for knowledge and self-realisa-</p>
<p>tion truly become liberated from material desires and enter</p>
<p>into a plane of eternal bliss. Ultimately they attain Krsna’s</p>
<p>Supreme Abode, never to return to the world of birth and</p>
<p>death as will be explained in Chapter 15. Therefore, the</p>
<p>seekers of self-realisation who take shelter of Krsna and</p>
<p>absorb all their thoughts and deeds in Krsna are considered</p>
<p>the best among virtuous persons.</p>

<p>After many births, one who possesses knowledge sutren-</p>
<p>ders unto Me. He realises that Vasudeva is the source of</p>
<p>everything. Such a great personality is very rare.</p>
