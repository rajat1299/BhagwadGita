<p>are addicted to illicit sex and who are not interested</p>
<p>in the cultivation of the Absolute Truth. (Caitan-</p>
<p>ya-caritamrta, Madhya-lila 2.2.87)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Supreme Abode of Sti Krsna is the final destina-</p>
<p>tion of the bhakti-yogi and Krsna says that His abode is not</p>
<p>illuminated by sun, moon or fire. Not illuminated by sun,</p>
<p>moon or fire means that the Supreme Abode is beyond the</p>
<p>reach of the darkness that exists in the material world. In</p>
<p>the Supreme Abode of Krsna, known by great self-realised</p>
<p>yogis as Goloka Vrndavana, everything is filled with the</p>
<p>self-effulgence of Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>na tatra siryo bbati na candra-tarakarn</p>
<p>nema vidyuto bhanti kutoâ€™yam agnih</p>
<p>tam eva bhantam anubbati sarvari</p>
<p>tasya bhasa sarvam idarh vibbati</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the</p>
<p>stars, nor does lightning shine. How then can fire</p>
<p>barn? When The Supreme Being shines, all these</p>
<p>shine. Through His effulgence He illuminates all</p>
<p>things. (Katha Upanisad 2.2.15)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna also says that once attaining that Supreme Abode,</p>
<p>one never returns to this world of birth and death. The</p>
<p>material world is filled with unlimited fallibilities, but the</p>
<p>Supreme Abode is infallible. The fallibility of the material</p>
<p>world includes envy, greed, lust, hate, vengefulness etc. bat</p>
<p>these material qualities cannot enter the abode of Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some thinkers have postulated that the living beings in</p>
<p></p>
<p>this material world have originally fallen from their eternal</p>
