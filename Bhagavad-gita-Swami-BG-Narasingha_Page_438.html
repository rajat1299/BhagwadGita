<p>sannyast. To be a Sannyast means to act for the benefit</p>
<p>of the complete whole, the Absolute Good, Sti Krsna. A</p>
<p>sannyast performs all types of actions, but does so only in</p>
<p>bhakti~yoga, in the service of Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The social structure of the bhakti-yoga community is</p>
<p>divided into four spiritual orders — brabmacari, grhastha,</p>
<p>vanaprastha and sannyasa. Al these are to study the Vedic</p>
<p>literature. Additionally, their duties are as follows: the</p>
<p>brabmacaris are the students, whose duties are service to the</p>
<p>spititual master and the observance of celibacy. Grhasthas</p>
<p>are the householders, whose duties are to earn an honest</p>
<p>living, to give in charity and to taise children. Vanaprasthas</p>
<p>ate those who have completed household affairs and whose</p>
<p>duties are to relinguish their wealth, visit holy places and</p>
<p>cultivate detachment. The sannyasis are the spiritual mas-</p>
<p>ters in the bbakti-yoga community and they are to give</p>
<p>lessons to the brabmacaris, grbasthas and vanaprasthas, to</p>
<p>be renounced from worldly pleasure, to be detached from</p>
<p>politics and to always be engaged in bhakti-yoga with kaya,</p>
<p>mana, vakya, iva -- by body, mind, words and the full sur-</p>
<p>render of the self. Sannyasa and tyaga are further described</p>
<p></p>
<p>in the coming verses.</p>
