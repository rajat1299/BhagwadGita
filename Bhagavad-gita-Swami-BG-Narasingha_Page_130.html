<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>The knowledge of yoga being lost naturally results in</p>
<p>a decline in dharma and a tise of adbarma (false dharma).</p>
<p>Malevolence atises out of adbarma. When this occuts,</p>
<p>Krsna says that He appears in the world to re-establish</p>
<p>the principles of dharma. Dharma is understood as duties,</p>
<p>activities and practices that will sustain the living beings</p>
<p>in a state of prosperity and enable them to tealise their</p>
<p>constitutional position as conscious parts and parcels of</p>
<p>the Absolute Truth, Krsna. As such, dharma should not be</p>
<p>confused with the mundane religions of this world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse 8 Krsna says that He appears in every age (yuge</p>
<p></p>
<p>“yuge) to establish the yuga-dharma. In Satya-yuga, Krsna</p>
<p>appeared as Harhsa, Matsya, Kiirma, Varaha and Nar-</p>
<p>asitnha avataras. In Treta-yuga, He appeared as Vamana,</p>
<p>Paragurama and Ramacandra avataras. In Dvapara-yuga, He</p>
<p>appeared as Sti Krsna and in Kali-yuga, He has appeared as</p>
<p>Buddha and Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu. There is one more</p>
<p>avatira yet to appear at the end of Kali-yuga, some 427,000</p>
<p>years from now, and that is Kalki.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Krsna was speaking Bhagavad-gita, it was at the</p>
<p>end of Dvapara-yuga — an age of considerable piety where</p>
<p>open degradation such as establishments for the consump-</p>
<p>tion of alcohol, illicit sex, political corruption, drug abuse</p>
<p>and the organised slaughter of animals were completely</p>
<p>unheard of. Now, five thousand yeats on, we are in the</p>
<p>midst of the age known as Kali-yuga where the unheard of</p>
<p>vices in Dvapata-yuga are the norm of the day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, as Krsna had appeared at the end of Dvapa-</p>
<p>ra-yuga, He again appeared after the first 4,576 years</p>
<p>of Kali-yuga had passed as the avatara, Sti Caitanya</p>
<p>Mahaprabhu. Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu is also known as</p>
