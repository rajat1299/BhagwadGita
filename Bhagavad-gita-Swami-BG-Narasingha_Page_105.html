<p>citca 500 BCE. Prior to the arrival of the Persians, and</p>
<p>continuing into the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, Judaism and</p>
<p>Christianity were known to have belief systems based on</p>
<p>one ot mote gods. Thus, monotheism only gradually devel-</p>
<p>oped among the Abrahamic religions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the monotheistic concept found in the Vedas is</p>
<p>mach older than the Abrahamic religions, it is only logical</p>
<p>to conclude that the latter borrowed their thinking from</p>
<p>the former. Dating the interim, the Persians, under the</p>
<p>influence of Zoroaster, took the monotheistic philosop hy</p>
<p>from India and then transmitted it to the Middle Eastern</p>
<p>civilisations. Indeed, monotheism has always been the cen-</p>
<p>tral theme of Indiaâ€™s Vedic literature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, failing to look deeply into the philosophy</p>
<p>of the Vedas or possibly being culturally intimidated by</p>
<p>the superiority of Vedic knowledge as opposed to western</p>
<p>philosophies and religions, Eurocentric academics and fun-</p>
<p>damental religionists have marginalised the ancient Vedic</p>
<p>civilisation of India. The German scholar Max Muller</p>
<p>propagated further misinformation on this subject in the</p>
<p>19th Century with the invention of the Aryan Invasion</p>
<p>Theory, stating that Vedic civilisation did not originate in</p>
<p>India. Yet all this is quite far from the trath.</p>
<p>According to Muller, the aryans were a nomadic tribe</p>
<p></p>
<p>from Europe who invaded India. Yet there is no evidence</p>
<p>that the aryans were nomads. In fact, to suggest that a</p>
<p>nomadic tribe of barbarians wrote literature of such pro-</p>
<p></p>
<p>found wisdom as the Vedas defies imagination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the Vedas, there is no mention what-</p>
<p></p>
<p>soever of an original homeland, and atchaeologically there</p>
<p></p>
<p>is a complete lack of evidence to prove an invasion ever</p>
