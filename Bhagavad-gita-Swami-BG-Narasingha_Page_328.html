<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a question for many persons starting on the</p>
<p>path of transcendence — which path is better, the personal</p>
<p>ot the impersonal? Here, Sti Krsna says that the personal</p>
<p>path is best. The bhakti-yogi, who is fixed in meditation on</p>
<p>Krsna’s form of beauty, who constantly glorifies Him with</p>
<p>great faith and determination is the best of yogis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bhakti-yogis that engage on the personal path of</p>
<p>self-realisation ate called Vaisnavas. Those on the imper-</p>
<p>sonal path are of three types — Brahmavadis (Vedantists),</p>
<p>Sanyavadis (Buddhists) and Mayavadis (Sankarites).</p>
<p>Brahmavadis are those who seek to merge the self (atma)</p>
<p>into the bodily effulgence of Krsna. Sanyavadis seek to</p>
<p></p>
<p>annihilate everything and enter the void (Sanya) and the</p>
<p>Mayavadis seek to become God themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Brahmavadis seck to merge with the Brahman</p>
<p>effulgence, bat they have little or no knowledge of the</p>
<p>personal form of Krsna. Thus they only reach Krsna after</p>
<p>many lifetimes as will be explained in verse 4. In the annals</p>
<p>of self-realisation, there are many instances of yogis and</p>
<p>Brahmavadis failing to achieve Brahman realisation and</p>
<p>even accounts of those such as the Four Kumaras, Vasistha</p>
<p>Muni, Sukadeva Gosvami and others, who after achieving</p>
<p>Brahman realisation, abandoned that for the higher bliss</p>
<p></p>
<p>of bhakti-yoga. For the seekers of Saimya there is never</p>
<p></p>
<p>success because there is no Sanya. There is no void any-</p>
<p>where. There is nothing outside or beyond Krsna and so</p>
<p>the Sanyavadis face great disappointment at the end of</p>
<p>life. The Mayavadis reject the personal form of Krsna as</p>
<p>a manifestation of maya (illusion) and want to become</p>
<p>God themselves. Mayavadis are considered offenders and</p>
<p>return to the world of birth and death.</p>
