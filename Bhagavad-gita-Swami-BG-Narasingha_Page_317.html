<p>“yy CHAPTER 11 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>adrsta-purvarh brsito’smi drstva</p>
<p>bhayena ca pravyathitarh mano me</p>
<p>tad eva me dargaya deva ॥1</p>
<p>prasida devesa jagannivasa</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am happy to have seen this universal form of Youts,</p>
<p>which has never been seen before. Yet my mind is over-</p>
<p>come by fear. Therefore, O Master of the demigods, kindly</p>
<p></p>
<p>show me that form of Narayana, the refuge of the universe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 46</p>
<p>किरीटिनं गदिनं चक्रहस्तम्‌ इच्छामि त्वा ्रष्ुमहं तथैव ।</p>
<p>तेनैव रूपेण चतुर्भुजेन सहस्रवाहो भव विश्वमूतं ॥४५॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>kiritinarh दवाय cakra-bastarh</p>
<p>icchami tvam drastum abati tathaiva</p>
<p>tenaiva ripena catur-bhujena</p>
<p>sabasra-babo bhava visva-miirte</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wish to see that form of Yours wearing a crown and car-</p>
<p>rying the club and disc-weapon in Your hands. O one with</p>
<p>a thousand arms, O universal form, now kindly reveal to</p>
<p>me Your four-armed form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna has been showering praises upon Sti Krsna after</p>
<p>seeing His universal form of great wonder, but then he</p>
<p>regrets that in many instances he may have offended Krsna</p>
<p>by addressing Him as, “O Krsna,” “O friend,” or by play-</p>
<p>ing or relaxing with Krsna. Thus Arjuna requests Krsna’s</p>
<p>forgiveness for any transgressions that he might have made</p>
<p>and then earnestly requests Krsna to show him His four-</p>
<p></p>
<p>atmed form as Narayana.</p>
