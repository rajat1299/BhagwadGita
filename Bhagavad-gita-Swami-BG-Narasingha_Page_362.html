<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Paramatma enters the material nature and makes</p>
<p>all things possible within that nature, but He Himself 15</p>
<p>nevet contaminated. He is never in illusion, never under the</p>
<p>influence of time, never subject to death or the reactions to</p>
<p>work and the laws of material nature. Super Consciousness</p>
<p>is always the Master of matetial nature and material nature</p>
<p>is always subservient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the living beings ate situated within the mate-</p>
<p>tial body, they do not actually mix ot become one with</p>
<p>it. The living beings are always distinct from the material</p>
<p>body even when the living beings are conditioned by it.</p>
<p>One who knows this in relation to Sti Krsna, attains the</p>
<p></p>
<p>supreme goal of life.</p>
