<p></p>
<p>vas that they were correct in destroying their enemies?</p>
<p>The difference is that Kuruksetra was not fought because</p>
<p>one side had a different religious ideology than the other.</p>
<p>Kuruksetra was a fratricidal war — a family feud brought</p>
<p>on by haman faults: greed for sovereignty, failure in duty,</p>
<p>envy, family attachment and falsely identifying the body</p>
<p>as the self.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But unlike any other war in history, Kutuksetra would</p>
<p>record a profound lesson for the benefit of all future gen-</p>
<p>erations. The lesson was taught by Sti Krsna in the form</p>
<p>of Bhagavad-gita — a lesson that would enable humanity to</p>
<p>overcome its mundane shortcomings, become established</p>
<p>in transcendence and attain self-realisation.</p>

<p>Speaking to Dhrtarastra, Satjaya said: O emperor, just as</p>
<p>the war was about to commence, Arjuna, whose chariot</p>
<p>was decorated with the banner of Hanuman, observing</p>
<p>your sons poised for battle, took up his bow and. spoke to</p>
<p>Hrsikesa ( Krsna, the Master of the senses), as follows.</p>
