<p>अ CHAPTER 6 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>understanding Bhagavad-gita. Krsna</p>
<p>and means what He says — therefore</p>
<p></p>
<p>says what He means</p>
<p></p>
<p>an abstract commen-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tary on Bhagavad-gita is not necessaty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That Sti Krsna is everywhere, in</p>
<p></p>
<p>all things and within</p>
<p></p>
<p>the hearts of all living beings is confirmed by the above</p>
<p></p>
<p>verses. Krsna says that He is in a living beings as the Par-</p>
<p></p>
<p>amatma and all living beings are in Him as His parts and</p>
<p></p>
<p>parcels. Krsna is in all things and all things are in Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who endeavours to see in this way becomes enlight-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ened — indeed such a vision is en ightenment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna, being ase f-realised yogi and an eternal associ-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ate of Krsna, does not argue with Kr</p>
<p></p>
<p>sna ovet such concla-</p>
<p></p>
<p>sions. However, Arjuna does object to the rigours of yoga</p>
<p></p>
<p>required to attain such perfection. Atj</p>
<p></p>
<p>una Was a family man</p>
<p></p>
<p>with many responsibilities, so how was he to practice yoga?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna pleads his case in favour of</p>
<p></p>
<p>day to day people in</p>
<p></p>
<p>that the yoga system of rigorous mind control described so</p>
<p></p>
<p>far by Krsna is too difficult. It is simply impractical.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna’s assurance to Atjana is that if one perseveres</p>
<p></p>
<p>then one will certainly be successful. But understanding</p>
<p></p>
<p>Atjuna’s point, Krsna will indeed bring the attainment</p>
<p></p>
<p>of the Absolute Truth into the reach of everyone as the</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita discourse continues.</p>
