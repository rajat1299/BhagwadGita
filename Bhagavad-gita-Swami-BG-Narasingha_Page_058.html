<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>decided to put aside his casual relationship with Krsna as a</p>
<p>friend and accept Sti Krsna as his gura (spititual master).</p>
<p>Thus Krsna accepted Arjuna as a disciple.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to Vedic knowledge there are numerous</p>
<p>planets and parallel universes wherein life can be found.</p>
<p>Some of these planets and universes have higher standards</p>
<p>of living than we experience on Earth and some are lower.</p>
<p>If one performs one’s prescribed duties in this life then</p>
<p>according ly, one is elevated to higher planets. However, if</p>
<p>one neglects his duty then only infamy and descending to</p>
<p></p>
<p>ower planets awaits one in the next life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna has used the word anarya meaning ‘non-aryan’</p>
<p>to describe Atjuna’s disinclination to follow his prescribed</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vedic duties. For centuries there has been much contto-</p>
<p></p>
<p>versy about who is an aryan and where the aryans came</p>
<p>ftom. For the most part, all such considerations have been</p>
<p></p>
<p>based upon bodily designations in order to establish one</p>
<p>race of people as superior to another. But in Bhagavad-gita,</p>
<p>according to the words of Sti Krsna, the aryans are those</p>
<p>who catty out their duties in accordance with the Vedic</p>
<p>injunctions. Thus it is understood that the word aryan</p>
<p>does not pertain to a particular race of people, but to a</p>
<p>conception of life and a way of living.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Knowledge of the eternal existence of the infinite con-</p>
<p>sciousness (Krsna) and the finite individual unit of con-</p>
<p>sciousness (atma or the self) is the key to all Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>This will be the central theme of Krsna’s instruction to</p>
<p>Arjuna in this chapter.</p>
