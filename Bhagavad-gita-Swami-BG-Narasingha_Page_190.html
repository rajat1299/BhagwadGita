<p>VERSE 28</p>
<p>युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मषः ।</p>
<p>सुखेनन््यसंस्परौमत्यन्तं सुखमश्ुते ॥२८॥</p>

<p>yuitjann evarh sadatmanath yogt viga ta~kalmasab</p>

<p></p>
<p>In this way, through the constant practice of yoga, a yogi who</p>
<p>is devoid of material contamination can attain eternal bliss</p>
<p>through contact with the Absolute.</p>

<p>Control of the mind is quintessential for the practice of</p>
<p>yoga. The problem arises due to the very nature of the mind</p>
<p>itself. The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady; it</p>
<p>wants to wander here and there from one sense-object to</p>

<p>Sti Kysna says that the yogi must always endeavour to bring</p>
<p>the mind under control of his higher conscious self. This is</p>
<p>indeed the foremost challenge that a yogt faces.</p>

<p>In some western philosophical systems the mind is</p>
<p>conceived of as the self, but this does not hold true in</p>
<p>yoga. In yoga, the mind is called ‘the sense within’. The</p>
<p></p>
<p>senses of the body like sight, sound, touch, smell and taste</p>
<p>are engaged with external objects and the mind acts as the</p>
<p>faculty that ultimately makes sense of sensual experiences</p>
<p>— the sense within. But in yoga the self is conceived of as</p>
<p>a transcendental substance that exists independent of the</p>
<p></p>
<p>mind and body. Therefore, according to the knowledge of</p>
<p></p>
<p>yoga, the self survives the death of the body and mind. It is</p>
<p></p>
<p>something completely different.</p>
<p>There are many external practices within the yoga system</p>
<p></p>
<p>such as fasting and living in a secluded place that help to</p>
