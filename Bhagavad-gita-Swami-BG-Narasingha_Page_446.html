<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Knowledge in which the one undivided, imperishable ele-</p>
<p>ment is perceived in all variegated species of life is consid-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ered to be knowledge in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 21</p>
<p>पृथक्त्वेन तु यज्ज्ञानं नानाभावान्पृथग्विधान्‌ ।</p>
<p>वेत्ति सर्वषु भूतेषु तज्ज्ञानं विचि राजसम्‌ ॥ २९॥</p>
<p>pribaktvena tu yaj jana nana-bhavan prthag-vidhan</p>
<p>vetti sarvesu bhitesu taj jaanarh viddbi rajasam</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, that knowledge by which one perceives that</p>
<p>within different bodies there is a different kind of living</p>
<p>being, is known to be in the mode of passion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 22</p>
<p>यन्तु PHS सक्तमहैतुकम्‌ ।</p>
<p>AAA AAT च तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्‌ ॥२२॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>yat tu krtsnavad ckasmin karye saktam abaitukam</p>
<p>atattvarthavad alparh ca tat tamasam udabrtam</p>
<p></p>
<p>That knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of</p>
<p>activity, that is without any truth and based upon trivial</p>
<p>pursuits is known as knowledge in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p>Knowledge, as previously explained, means to under-</p>
<p>stand the difference between matter and consciousness.</p>
<p>Those whose knowledge is pure and uncontaminated see</p>
<p>individual consciousness as parts and parcels of the undi-</p>
<p>vided Super Consciousness, as present in all species and as</p>
<p>॥ from one body to the next, life after life. In</p>
<p></p>
<p>other words, the same atma may be present in one life in</p>
