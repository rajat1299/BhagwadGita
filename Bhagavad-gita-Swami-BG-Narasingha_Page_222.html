<p>able. To this He adds that those who are foolish (miidha),</p>
<p>consider His appearance in this world to be a temporary</p>
<p>appearance of the impersonal Brahman in material form.</p>
<p>Such misguided philosophets consider that Krsna’s body is</p>
<p>material and that Krsna, like other living beings, is a man-</p>
<p>ifestation from the brabma-jyoti. In Chapter 14 of Bhaga~</p>
<p>vad-gita, Krsna will explain that He is the very source of</p>
<p>the brabma-jyoti and that all living beings emanate from</p>
<p>Him. Krsna does not manifest or reveal Himself to every-</p>
<p>one — particularly to those who are envious or jealous of</p>
<p>Him. To the envious Krsna is covered by His own spititual</p>
<p>potency, yoga-maya and at the same time the envious are</p>
<p></p>
<p>covered by maha-maya in the cycle of birth and death.</p>

<p>O Arjuna, I know past, present and future. I know all living</p>
<p>beings, but they do not know Me.</p>

<p>all living beings are born bewildered by the dualities of</p>
<p>desire and hatred.</p>
