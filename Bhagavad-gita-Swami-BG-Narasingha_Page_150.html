<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>of submissive ingquity (paripragna) and service (seva). Being</p>
<p>satisfied by sach submissive inquity and service, the tatt-</p>
<p>va-darsi will instruct and initiate the disciple in the sacred</p>
<p>science of yoga. In other words, Krsna is telling Arjana</p>
<p>that to know the truth he must approach a spiritual master</p>
<p>(gure) and become his disciple.</p>
<p></p>
<p>guru-padasrayas-tasmat krsna-diksadi-Siksanam</p>
<p>visrambhena gurob seva sadbu-vartmanu-vartanam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Firstly one must surtender at the feet of the guru,</p>
<p>receive training from him by accepting spititual initi-</p>
<p>ation and instructions regarding Sti Krsna, serve the</p>
<p>guru with affection and follow in the footsteps of the</p>
<p>sadbus. (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindbu 1.2.74)</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the representative of Krsna, the instruction of the</p>
<p>guru, or acarya, should be heeded. The genuine gura isa</p>
<p>representative of Krsna (Paramatma) and is of two types —</p>
<p>diksa and Siksa. The diksa-guru gives initiation and accepts</p>
<p>the student or disciple as a member of the parampara. Such</p>
<p>initiations are not secret and are held in plain view of the</p>
<p>public, bat at the initiation ceremony the disciple receives</p>
<p>the maba-mantra and gayatri-mantras for meditation. The</p>
<p>Siksa-guru is one who imparts practical instructions to the</p>
<p>disciple for the progressive advancement in self-realisation.</p>
<p>The function of diksa and siksai may be performed by the</p>
<p>same gutu, or by different gurus, bat in any case both the</p>
<p>diksa and siksa gurus must be representatives of Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus, one should see the gura as non-different from Krsna</p>
<p>and should offer him all respect. Krsna confirms this in</p>
<p></p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam as follows:</p>
