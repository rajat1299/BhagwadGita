<p></p>
<p>Bewilderment and conditioning under the modes of</p>
<p>material nature is difficult to overcome, but it is possible</p>
<p>when one cultivates the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita and</p>
<p>applies oneself sincerely to the process of bhakti-yoga. The</p>
<p>knowledge attained through the study of Bhagavad-gita</p>
<p>enables one to transcend the modes of nature because such</p>
<p>knowledge is in itself transcendental and free from the</p>
<p>defects of mistakes (bhrama), illusion (pramada), cheating</p>
<p>(vipralipsa) and false perception (karanapatava). In other</p>
<p></p>
<p>words, the knowledge contained in Bhagavad-gita is perfect</p>
<p>and complete. By transcending the modes of nature, Sti</p>
<p>Kysna promises that one will be liberated from the miseries</p>
<p>of birth, death, old age and disease and one will taste the</p>
<p>nectar of immortality. This is also confirmed in the Tgo~</p>
<p>panisad as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>vidyarh cavidyarh ca yas tad vedobbayarh saba</p>
<p>avidyaya mrtyurh tirtva vidyayamrtam asnute</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who transcends ignorance (avidya) and attains</p>
<p>transcendental knowledge certainly rises above the</p>
<p>influence of repeated birth and death and tastes the</p>
<p>nectat of immottality. (ESopanisad 11)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The contemporary world view of advancement of</p>
<p>knowledge is that knowledge is attained through direct</p>
<p>evidence, experiment, hypothesis and speculation. This</p>
<p>process of acquiting knowledge is called aroha-pantha, or</p>
<p></p>
<p>the ascending process. However, the ascending process</p>
