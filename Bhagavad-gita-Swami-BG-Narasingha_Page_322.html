<p>as Narayana and thus Krsna resumed His original two-</p>
<p>atmed form as Syamasundara. Those who have a direct</p>
<p>relationship with Krsna are most fortunate and are never</p>
<p>satisfied by seeing any other avatara of Krsna besides that</p>
<p>of His original form. A similar situation is narrated in the</p>
<p>book Brhad-bhagavatamrta, wherein Gopa Kumara found</p>
<p>himself in Vaikuntha in the presence of Narayana, but did</p>
<p>not feel comfortable or at home. Because Gopa Kumara has</p>
<p>an eternal relationship with Krsna in Goloka Vrndavana,</p>
<p>even being in the presence of the majestic Narayana in</p>
<p>Vaikuntha could not pacify him. Thus he continued his</p>
<p>journey until at last, he reached the Supreme Abode and</p>
<p>the sweet embrace of Krsna. Sach is the great fortune of</p>
<p>Kysna’s devotee, who is always guided by Him and ulti-</p>
<p></p>
<p>mately attains His sweet embrace.</p>
