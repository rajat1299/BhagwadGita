<p>Myf CHAPTER 18 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 66</p>
<p>सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं वरज ।</p>
<p>अहं त्वं सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः ॥६६॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>sarva~dharman parityajya mam chart Saranatih vraja</p>
<p>aban tvarh sarva~papebbyo moksayisyami ma Sucab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Abandon all types of dharma — come and surrender unto</p>
<p>Me alone! Do not fear, for I will surely deliver you from</p>
<p>all reactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse 63 Sti Krsna says that He has disclosed to</p>
<p>Arjuna the most confidential knowledge and tells Arjuna</p>
<p>to deliberate upon it and then do as he wishes. But because</p>
<p>Atjuna is very deat to Krsna and because Krsna is Atju-</p>
<p>na’s gura and well-wisher, Krsna again gives him one last</p>
<p>instruction and assurance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna’s final instruction is that Arjuna should always</p>
<p>fix his mind upon Him, he should devote himself fully to</p>
<p>Him, worship Him and offer his respects unto Him. This</p>
<p>is the essence of Krsna consciousness. Krsna says that by</p>
<p>doing this Arjuna will surely come to Him. The ultimate</p>
<p>insttuction to always remember Krsna is also stated in</p>
<p>Padma Purana as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>smartavyab Satatarh visnur vismartavyo na jatucit</p>
<p>sarve vidhi-nisedbab syur etayor eva kinkarab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna (Visna) should always be remembered and</p>
<p>never be forgotten at anytime. All rules and regula-</p>
<p>tions mentioned in the Sastra should be subservient</p>
<p></p>
<p>to these two principles. (Padma Purana 6.71.100)</p>
