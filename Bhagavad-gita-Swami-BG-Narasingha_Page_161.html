<p>renounced persons who live a life of sacrifice, austerity and</p>
<p>cultivation of knowledge. Sannyasis ace considered to be at</p>
<p>the crest of all social and spiritual orders of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vedic scholars sometimes debate whether sannya-</p>
<p>sa~yoga (complete renunciation of activities) or karma-yoga</p>
<p>(actions performed selflessly) is better. Sti Krsna says in</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita that both Sannyasa~yoga and karma~yoga are</p>
<p>favourable for liberation. Both paths ultimately lead to the</p>
<p>same goal, but of the two, the path of karma~yoga is pref-</p>
<p>erable. This subject is controversial among some scholars</p>
<p>because, according to their understanding, karma~yoga is</p>
<p>the performance of philanthropic works that are beneficial</p>
<p>to the downtrodden section of society such as the poor and</p>
<p>the hungry. Such welfare work is indeed noble, but one</p>
<p>should understand that when Krsna speaks of karma~yoga</p>
<p>in the Gita, He is specifically speaking about activities</p>
<p>that are performed for His satisfaction and pleasure. Such</p>
<p>activities ate also known as karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga</p>
<p>because the result of action is offered to Krsna. In other</p>
<p>words, noble philanthropic activities are ‘good karma’ but</p>
<p>not karma~yoga, unless they ate offered to Krsna and per-</p>
<p>formed on His behalf.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When karma-yoga is established as bhakti-yoga then</p>
<p>its superior advantage over sannyasa~yoga is immediately</p>
<p>understood. Sannyasa~yoga is very, very difficult to exe-</p>
<p>cute. One has to strictly control the senses and renounce</p>
<p></p>
<p>even the simplest comforts of life such as a warm bath,</p>
<p>comfortable sleeping place etc. One has to live in the</p>
<p>forest, fast regularly and observe other austerities sach as</p>
<p>sexual abstinence. For most people, this is very difficult,</p>
<p></p>
<p>if not impossible.</p>
