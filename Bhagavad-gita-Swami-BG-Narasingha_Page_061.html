<p>अ CHAPTER2 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>O son of Kunti, the interaction between the senses and the</p>
<p>sense-objects produce the sensations of cold, heat, pleasure</p>
<p>and pain. These feelings are temporary, always appearing</p>
<p>and then disappearing. Thus, O descendant of Bharata, you</p>
<p></p>
<p>must learn to tolerate them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 15</p>
<p>यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ |</p>
<p>समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥ ९५॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>yath bi na vyathayanty-ete purusarh purusarsabba</p>
<p>sama-dubkba-sukbarh dhirarh so’mrtatvaya kalpate</p>
<p></p>
<p>O most virtuous one, a sober man who is equipoised in</p>
<p>both pleasure and pain and remains undisturbed is cer-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tainly qualified for liberation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna is lamenting for the loss of the body, but St</p>
<p>Krsna does not approve of his lamentation and reminds</p>
<p>Arjana that all living beings are eternal. Krsna says that</p>
<p>He, Arjana and all those present on the field of battle are</p>
<p>eternal personalities — they have existed eternally in the</p>
<p>past and they will exist eternally in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Atjuna is an accomplished student of Vedic thought and</p>
<p>an associate of Sti Krsna, bat for the benefit of those who</p>
<p>will study this erudite conversation in the future, Atjana</p>
<p>is feigning bewilderment and confusion just to encourage</p>
<p>the discourse. Arjuna is considered a liberated personality</p>
<p></p>
<p>and thus he is actually above ignorance and bewilderment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although consciousness is eternal, the material body</p>
<p>does not share this quality. The body passes through the</p>
<p>stages of birth, childhood, youth, old age, disease and</p>
