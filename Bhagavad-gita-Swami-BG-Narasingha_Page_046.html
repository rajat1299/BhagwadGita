<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figuratively speaking we would say that Arjuna was</p>
<p>‘caught between a hard spot and 3 rock’. Therefore, Arjana</p>
<p>intelligently approached Sti Krsna and appealed for His</p>
<p>intervention. Knowing that Sti Krsna was the Absolute</p>
<p>Trath, complete with all opulence and knowledge, Arjuna</p>
<p>apptoached Sti Krsna, addressing Him as Hrsikeéa (Master</p>
<p>of the senses), as Acyuta (the infallible), as Keégava (the</p>
<p>killer of the Keéi demon), as Govinda (one who pleases</p>
<p>the senses), as Madhusiidana (the killer of the Madhu</p>
<p>demon), as Janardana (the Maintainer of all living beings),</p>
<p>as Madhava (the husband of the goddess of fortune) and as</p>
<p>Varsneya (the descendant of the Vrsni Dynasty).</p>
<p>Arjuna addressed Sti Krsna by His different names</p>
<p></p>
<p>in order to invoke Krsna’s mercy and compassion for</p>
<p>the predicament that Atjana was in. As Hrsikeéa, Krsna</p>
<p>is the Master of the mind and senses — thus He is never</p>
<p>bewildered or put into illusion. As Acyuta, He is incapa-</p>
<p>ble of making mistakes or wrong decisions. Arjuna needed</p>
<p>Krsna’s advice urgently — advice that he could depend on,</p>
<p>that would give relief to his disturbed mind and senses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Keégava, Krsna is the killer of the demon Keéi who</p>
<p>represents the false sense of greatness. Sti Krsna is known</p>
<p>to have killed numerous demons during His advent and</p>
<p></p>
<p>+</p>
<p></p>
<p>each of those demons represented negative qualities thai</p>
<p></p>
<p>hinder one’s progress in spititual life such as the desire for</p>
<p>name and fame, dishonesty, false pride, deceitfalness, cru-</p>
<p>elty, foolishness, violence, lust, anger, greed, false teachings</p>
<p>and bad habits etc. Arjuna was confident that by taking</p>
<p>shelter of Sti Kysna, all that was an impediment to his sit-</p>
<p></p>
<p>uation would be removed.</p>
