<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>

<p>VERSE 36</p>
<p>असंयतात्मना योगो दुष्प्राप इति मे मतिः |</p>
<p>FRAT तु यतता शक्योऽवापुमुपायतः ॥३६॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>asathyatatmana yogo dusprapa iti me matib</p>
<p>vasyatmand tu yatata Sakyo’vaptum updyatab</p>
<p></p>
<p>My conclusion is that yoga is difficult to attain if one’s</p>
<p>mind is uncontrolled. But one who endeavours to control</p>
<p></p>
<p>the mind by the proper practice can be successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrttt</p>
<p></p>
<p>There ate five primary subject matters explained in</p>
<p>Bhagavad -gita, namely atma Cindividual consciousness),</p>
<p>prakrti (material nature), karma (action), kala (time) and</p>
<p>Tévara (the Supreme Controller). The culmination of</p>
<p>knowledge is to understand Sti Krsna as the underlying</p>
<p>principle of everything. Yet some commentators on Bhaga~</p>
<p>vad-gita have tried to explain the Gita minus Krsna. That is</p>
<p>to say, they have said such things as, “Krsna was a tempo-</p>
<p>tay manifestation of the Supreme Brahman,” “Krsna has</p>
<p>no eternal existence as a person” or that when Krsna says</p>
<p>things like, “One attains My abode,” Krsna actually means</p>
<p>that one attains something else of an impersonal natute.</p>
<p>However, true masters of yoga and scholars of Vedic liter-</p>
<p>ature reject all these ideas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavad -gita, although surely mystical in that it delin-</p>
<p>eates in great detail the Absolute Trath and how to attain</p>
<p>that Trath, is not an allegorical or speculative treatise on</p>
<p>the subject of perfection. Bhagavad-gita is to be taken lit-</p>
<p>erally as a conversation between Sti Krsna and His dear</p>
<p>friend and devotee, Arjuna. Therein lies the open secret to</p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt; 170 Es</p>
