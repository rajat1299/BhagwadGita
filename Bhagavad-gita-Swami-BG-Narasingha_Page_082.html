<p>times promote one to higher planets or higher standards</p>
<p>of living. Vikarma are those activities that are against the</p>
<p>Vedic injunctions and cause suffering to the self and to</p>
<p>other living creatures. Akarma means those activities that</p>
<p>have neither good nor bad reactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who is wise and who knows the science of yoga</p>
<p>always sttives to perform the activities of akarma. Such</p>
<p>yogis are known as bhakti~yogis and can easily situate them-</p>
<p>selves in transcendence. Other systems of yoga such as</p>
<p>astafga-yoga, rija~yoga, kundalini-yoga, hatha~yoga and</p>
<p>kriya-yoga can also reach transcendence, but the path is</p>
<p>very difficult, especially in this modern age.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna is known as Yogeévata, the Supreme Master</p>
<p>of yoga, and although Bhagavad-gita discusses other yoga</p>
<p>systems, it is the bhakti-yoga system that Krsna ultimately</p>
<p>recommends. The yogi situated in bhakti-yoga is always</p>
<p>engaged in devotional activities to satisfy the Supreme</p>
<p>Master of yoga, Sti Krsna. Thus, the bhakti-yogt is always</p>
<p>in complete control of his senses. Without control of the</p>
<p>senses no one can perform meditation or engage in spititual</p>
<p>practices properly. Therefore, the bhakti-yogi is the top-</p>
<p>most yogi because he is engaged in the topmost yoga system.</p>

<p>There are eight mystical perfections of yoga known 35 the</p>
<p>asta~siddhis. These perfections are — becoming very small</p>
<p>(anima-siddbi), becoming lighter than ait (laghima-siddhi),</p>
<p>being able to retrieve anything from anywhere, such as</p>
<p>extending one’s hand while in New York and picking a</p>
<p>mango growing in India (prapti-siddbi), to become heav-</p>
<p>ier than the heaviest (mabima-siddhi), to create something</p>
<p>wonderful ot to destroy anything at will (iSitva-siddhe), to</p>
<p>control the material elements (wasitva-siddbt), the ability to</p>
