<p>अ CHAPTER 6 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>take milk products, but the masters of yoga have never rec-</p>
<p>ommended such abnegation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Proper sitting posture, control of the senses and obsetv-</p>
<p>ing celibacy are also recommended in the above verses</p>
<p>because without such practices no one can actually be a</p>
<p>yogi. Gazing at the tip of the nose without casting one’s</p>
<p>glance in other directions means being perfectly concen-</p>
<p>trated, as in dbarana, and performing dhyana, or medita-</p>
<p>tion on Krsna as the highest goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As far as possible, a yogi should try to live in a holy</p>
<p>place to practice yoga. In India yogis are fond of residing on</p>
<p>the banks of the Ganges at Haridvara, Hrsikeéa, Benares,</p>
<p>or Mayapura, ot on the banks of another sacred river like</p>
<p>the Yamuna, Kaveri or Godavari. Some yogis prefer the</p>
<p>sanctuaty of the Himalayas, others prefer residence in the</p>
<p>cara-dbama (Dvaraka, Badarinatha, Jagannatha Puti and</p>
<p>Rameévatam). In any case, the yoo? must choose the proper</p>
<p>place to practice yoga.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If one is unable to live in a holy place or on the banks</p>
<p>of a sacred river, then one should try to live in an aSrama</p>
<p>ot yoga community. If one is unable to live in a yoga com-</p>
<p>munity then one should sanctify one’s home by creating a</p>
<p>place where Krsna can be worshipped and mantra medita-</p>
<p>tion can be performed. The home should have an atmos-</p>
<p>phere conducive for contemplation, study and controlling</p>
<p>the senses. Such a home should be peaceful and free from</p>
<p>acts of violence, animal killing, intoxication etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this modern age (Kali-yuga) animal killing, intoxi-</p>
<p>cation and so many other unfavourable activities are to be</p>
<p>found everywhere. Subsequently, it is very difficult to find</p>
<p>the appropriate place for yoga practice, especially for the</p>
