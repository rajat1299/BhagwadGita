<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>no void anywhere. Everything is the energy of the Absolute</p>
<p>Trath and no existence or non-existence is reconcilable</p>
<p>outside of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the prominent sages of bhakti-yoga,</p>
<p>Viévanatha Cakravarti translates brabma-nirvanam as lib-</p>
<p>eration. His disciple, Baladeva Vidyabhiisana understands</p>
<p>brabma-nirvanam as Paramatma who is Visna, the form</p>
<p>of liberation. Ramanuja takes Brahman as the atma and</p>
<p>nirvanam as full of happiness. Madhva takes brabma-nir-</p>
<p>vanam as Visna/Krsna without a material form. Bhakti</p>
<p>Raksaka Stidhara Maharaja takes brabma-nirvanam as</p>
<p>freedom from material bondage and A.C. Bhaktivedanta</p>
<p>Svami Prabhupada takes brabma-nirvanam as meaning</p>
<p>the kingdom of Visnu/Krsna. In all cases, the devotees</p>
<p>of Krsna never accept liberation in the impersonal state of</p>
<p>Brahman or the void because they are only interested in</p>
<p>service to Krsna and are already liberated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paramatma means realisation of the Absolute situated</p>
<p>in the hearts of all living things — the Maintainer of the</p>
<p></p>
<p>universe, being situated within and in between every parti-</p>
<p></p>
<p>cle of matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavan is the realisation of the personal aspect of</p>
<p>the Absolute Truth and is considered to be the ultimate</p>
<p>stage of self-realisation, because in that stage one realises</p>
<p>the Absolute Truth in toto as Krsna, the fountainhead of</p>
<p>all energies. The abode of Krsna is known as Vaikuntha or</p>
<p>Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, verse 71 refers to the abankara, or the</p>
<p></p>
<p>false ego, that is attached to consciousness when driven</p>
<p>by the modes of material nature. False ego presupposes</p>
<p></p>
<p>the existence of real ego — that real ego being the pure</p>
