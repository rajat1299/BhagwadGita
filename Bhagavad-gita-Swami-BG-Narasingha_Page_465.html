<p>Myf CHAPTER 18 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>O Arjuna, the Supreme Controller resides in the hearts of</p>
<p>all living beings. By His illusory energy He directs all their</p>
<p></p>
<p>activities as if they were mounted on a machine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 62</p>
<p>तमेव दारणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत ।</p>
<p>तत्मसादात्परां शान्तिं स्थानं प्राप्स्यसि शाश्वतम्‌ ॥६२॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>tam eva Saranarh gaccha sarva-bbavena bharata</p>
<p>tat prasadat pararh Santirh sthanarh prapsyasi Sasvatam</p>
<p></p>
<p>© Bharata, take shelter in Him with all your heart and</p>
<p>by His mercy you will achieve everlasting peace and the</p>
<p>Supreme Abode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna now gives Arjuna an infusion of encoutage-</p>
<p>ment by stating that by following His instructions Arjuna</p>
<p>will realise the Absolute Truth and will enter His Supreme</p>
<p>Abode. By consciously offering the results of all his actions</p>
<p>unto Krsna, by devoting himself to Krsna and always think-</p>
<p>ing about Krsna, Arjuna will achieve all perfection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The alternative, Krsna says, is that by neglecting His</p>
<p>instructions, Arjana will surely perish. This is the open</p>
<p>secret of Bhagavad-gita — one who adhetes to its message,</p>
<p>that is free from all material defects and is delivered by</p>
<p>the Supreme Person, Sti Krsna, becomes perfect in knowl-</p>
<p>edge and self-realisation. Neglecting Krsna’s instructions is</p>
<p></p>
<p>however tantamount to spititual suicide and Krsna warns</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna that if he takes that path he will surely perish into</p>
<p>the world of bewilderment, illusion and death.</p>
