<p></p>
<p>Cow protection (krsi-goraksya) is especially mentioned</p>
<p>in verse 44 because of all animals it is the cow that is most</p>
<p>necessaty for the survival of the human being. Human</p>
<p>bodies thrive on animal fat and the cow is the animal that</p>
<p>provides homan beings with the most milk, yogurt, butter,</p>
<p>cheese etc. Milk and milk products, when taken in appro-</p>
<p>priate quantities, provide the human being all the necessary</p>
<p>fat requited for healthy living, thus enabling the suspen-</p>
<p>sion of animal slaughter. In other words, killing animals</p>
<p>and eating meat is not necessaty to obtain fat. When cows</p>
<p>are protected then there will be plenty of whole milk avail-</p>
<p>able for everyone to maintain a healthy diet. The value of</p>
<p>the cow for human society is indisputable and therefore</p>
<p>in Vedic culture the cow is considered one of the seven</p>
<p></p>
<p>natural mothers. These seven mothers are as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>dtma-mata gurob patni brabmant raja-patnika</p>
<p>dhenur dhatrt tatha prtbvt saptaita matarab smrtab</p>
<p></p>
<p>One’s own mother, the wife of the guru, the wife of</p>
<p>a brabmana, the king’s wife, the cow, the nurse and</p>
<p>the Earth — these should be considered as our seven</p>
<p></p>
<p>mothers. (Canakya Niti-sastra 5.23)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the business community has turned to</p>
<p>corporate farming and mass slaughter of cows and other</p>
<p>animals in the name of delivering health and prosperity to</p>
<p>the people. In actuality, the people have lost their lands</p>
<p>and the family farm that was once the backbone of socie-</p>
<p>ties everywhere has ceased to exist. Industrial farming has</p>
