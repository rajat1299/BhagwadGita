<p>VERSE 4</p>
<p>मन्यसे यदि तच्छक्यं मया द्रष्टुमिति प्रभो ।</p>
<p>योगेश्वर ततो मे त्वं दर्शयात्मानमव्ययम्‌ ॥४॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>manyase yadi tac chakyarh maya drastum iti prabbo</p>
<p>yogesvara tato me tvarit darsayatmanam avyayam</p>
<p></p>
<p>O Master of all yogis, if You think that it is possible, then</p>
<p>kindly show that immortal form to me.</p>

<p>By the end of Chapter Ten, Arjuna is completely</p>
<p>convinced that Sti Kysna is the Supreme Person and that</p>
<p>all creation manifests from Him and remains in Him after</p>
<p>annihilation. But in order that future genetations may not</p>
<p>mistake Krsna for an ordinary man or simply a philoso-</p>
<p>phet, Arjuna requests Krsna to reveal His universal form</p>
<p>(vigvariipa) — the form of Krsna wherein everything in the</p>
<p>universe is contained. This form cannot be seen by any</p>
<p>independent endeavour, bat completely depends on the</p>
<p>metcy of Krsna for Arjuna to behold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna also knows that in the future unscrupulous men</p>
<p>will claim to be God and mislead ignorant people. There-</p>
<p>fore, Arjuna wants Krsna to show His universal form as the</p>
<p>benchmark so that anyone claiming to be God should be</p>
<p>able to show the universal form to confirm their position.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Indeed, Arjuna’s foresight was accurate. Since the time</p>
<p>of Krsna, and especially in modern times, many so-called</p>
<p>“godmen’ have stepped forward in society and claimed to</p>
<p>be Krsna or God incarnate. Unfortunately, the masses of</p>
<p>people ate so ignorant that they accept such impostots.</p>
<p>The greatest misfortune befalls a person when he or she</p>
