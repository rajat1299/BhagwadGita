<p>The first person to provide evidence and infer the</p>
<p>existence of the phenomenon of Dark Matter was the</p>
<p>Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, of the California Insti-</p>
<p>tute of Technology in 1933. Zwicky applied the viral</p>
<p>theorem to the Coma cluster of galaxies and obtained evi-</p>
<p>dence of unseen mass. Zwicky estimated the cluster’s total</p>
<p>mass based on the motions of galaxies neat its edge and</p>
<p>compared that estimate to one based on the number of</p>
<p>galaxies and total brightness of the cluster. He found that</p>
<p>there was about four-hundred times more estimated mass</p>
<p>than was visually observable. The gravity of the visible</p>
<p>galaxies in the cluster would be far too small for such fast</p>
<p>orbits, so something extta was required. This is known as</p>
<p></p>
<p>the “Missing Mass Problem’. Based on these conclusions,</p>
<p>Zwicky inferred that there must be some non-visible form</p>
<p></p>
<p>of matter that would provide enough of the mass and</p>
<p>gtavity to hold the cluster together. That was the begin-</p>
<p>ning of the search for Dark Matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seventy-eight years later, science is still looking for</p>
<p>Dark Matter. They know it is literally everywhete, but it</p>
<p>escapes detection and thus they ate unable to observe it.</p>
<p>Millions in taxpayers’ money is spent every year by western</p>
<p>scientists in the search for Dark Matter. Nothing has yet</p>
<p>been discovered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, the Srimad Bhagavatam identifies a material</p>
<p></p>
<p>element that among its other qual ities is, for the most part,</p>
<p></p>
<p>elusive. It is a -pervading, bat simultaneously it is unde-</p>
<p>tectable. That element according to Bhagavatam is called</p>
<p>nabbas, or as mentioned here in Bhagavad-gita, kbarit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The activities, qualities and characteristics of the kharit</p>
<p></p>
<p>element can be observed as accommodating space/room</p>
