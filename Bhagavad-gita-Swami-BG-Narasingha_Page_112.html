<p>Sti Kysna states in the above verses that He has no duty</p>
<p>to petform, that He lacks nothing not has He anything to</p>
<p>gain. In other words, Krsna is already perfect and complete</p>
<p>— ort piirnam. Yet Krsna acts; He 15 not idle. He acts for</p>
<p>the benefit of humanity by establishing spititual practices</p>
<p>in every age —dharmar tu saksad bhagavat-pranitarn. When</p>
<p>an avatara of the Absolute Truth makes His appearance in</p>
<p>the material world, He does so to establish eternal princi-</p>
<p>ples of dharma.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna appeared at the end of Dvapara-yuga, 5,237</p>
<p>yeats ago (3228 BCE) and spoke the Bhagavad-gita. How-</p>
<p>ever, this was not Kysna’s most recent appearance. Krsna</p>
<p>appeared again after the beginning of Kali-yuga 525</p>
<p>yeats ago. This Kali-yuga avatara of Krsna is known as</p>
<p>Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In His avatara as Sti Caitanya</p>
<p>Mahaprabhu, Krsna taught the process of sankirtana, the</p>
<p>congregational chanting of the maba-mantra, to accompany</p>
<p>the study of Bhagavad-gita. As regards the maha-mantra,</p>
<p>the Kalt-santarana Upanisad states as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare bare</p>
<p>bare rama bare rama rama rama bare bare</p>
<p></p>
<p>iti sodaSakarn namnam kali-kalmasa nasanam</p>
<p>natab parataropayab sarva-vedesu drsyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sixteen words of this maba-mantra are specif-</p>
<p>ically meant for counteracting the contamination</p>
<p>of Kali-yuga. There is no other way but to chant</p>
<p>these names of Krsna. After searching throughout</p>
