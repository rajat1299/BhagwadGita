<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 10</p>
<p>अपर्यासं तदस्माकं बलं भीष्माभिरक्षितम्‌ ।</p>
<p>पर्या त्विदमेतेषां बरं भीमाभिरक्षितम्‌ ॥ ९०॥</p>
<p>aparyaptarh tad asmakarh balarn bbismabbiraksitam</p>
<p>paryaptarh tv idam etesarn balarh bhimabbiraksitam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our army, protected by the might of Bhisma is unlimited.</p>
<p>However, the strength of the opposition, protected by</p>
<p>Bhima is insufficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 11</p>
<p>अयनेषु च सर्वेषु यथाभागमवस्थिताः।</p>
<p>भीष्ममेवाभिरकषन्तु भवन्तः सर्वं एव हि ॥ ११॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>ayanesu ca sarvesu yatha-bhagam avastbitab</p>
<p>bhismam evabbiraksantu bhavantab sarva eva bi</p>
<p></p>
<p>You must support and protect Bhisma at all costs, at the</p>
<p>strategic points of our battle formation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wat is nothing new to this world. Thousands of years</p>
<p>ago wats were being fought, such as the one at Kuruksetra,</p>
<p>to resolve the differences between good and evil and for</p>
<p>the purpose of material gain. From ancient times to our</p>
<p>modern era, practically not a day on this Earth has passed</p>
<p>when someone, somewhere, was not fighting over some-</p>
<p>thing. Throughout history men have gathered on the field</p>
<p>of battle to fulfil their greed for wealth and glory, some-</p>
<p>times nobly, bat more often ignobly. The same is happen-</p>
<p>ing in the 2Ist Century. War it seems is an unavoidable</p>
<p>karmic destiny of human civilisation.</p>
