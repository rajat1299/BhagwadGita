<p>अट CHAPTER 4 ABE</p>
<p></p>
<p>human and animal sacrifice as totally repugnant and cer-</p>
<p>tainly Sti Krsna would be in complete agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sacrifices mentioned here by Krsna mainly concern</p>
<p>the performance of austerities, breath control, study of the</p>
<p>Vedas, purification of knowledge, renunciation, observing</p>
<p>vows etc. The purpose of all such sacrifices is to advance</p>
<p>in tealisation of the Absolute Trath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt is often said that, “God is one” or that, “Tt is all</p>
<p></p>
<p>one”. This is trae, but there is a need to qualify such state-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ments. God is the Absolute Truth, one without a second,</p>
<p>but this does not mean that a living beings &gt;€ God. The</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita is straightforward on the point that all living</p>
<p></p>
<p>beings are eternally individual and never become God at</p>
<p>any time. Similarly, God is always the Absolute Truth and</p>
<p></p>
<p>nothing less.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt is said in verse 24 that the utensils of sacrifice are</p>
<p>Absolute, the sacred fire is Absolute, the priest or per-</p>
<p>former of sactifice is Absolute and one who is always</p>
<p>absorbed in thoughts of the Absolute attains the Absolute.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the individuality of any of these is</p>
<p>lost in the Absolute. Everything that comes in contact with</p>
<p>the Absolute Trath acquires the qualities of the Absolute</p>
<p>by association, but the individuality of each is maintained.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The point is also made that practically everything in</p>
<p>life depends on sactifice, even worldly pleasures. Without</p>
<p>sacrifice one cannot enjoy in this life or in the next. The</p>
<p>knowledge of, performing sactifice is essential for the stu-</p>
<p></p>
<p>dents of yoga. Knowing this one becomes liberated.</p>
