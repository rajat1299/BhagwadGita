<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>

<p>Yet the fool that believes only the self is the doer, cannot</p>
<p>understand this subject due to meagre intelligence.</p>

<p>VERSE 17</p>
<p>यस्य नाहंकृतो भावो वुचिरयस्य न लिप्यते |</p>
<p>हत्वापि स इरमोहटकान्न हन्ति न निवध्यते ॥ १७॥</p>

<p>-yasya nabankrto bhavo buddbir yasya na lipyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>batva’pi sa imal-lokan na hanti na nibadbyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who have no false ego and whose minds are detached</p>
<p>—even if they kill everyone on this battlefield, they actually</p>
<p>do not kill and are not bound by their actions.</p>

<p>Arjana isa ksatrtya, a watrior, and he stands with Sti</p>
<p>Krsna on the battlefield of Kuruksetra between two great</p>
<p>armies. Seeing friends and well-wishers on both sides,</p>
<p>Arjana initially resolved not to fight, bat to throw down</p>
<p>his weapons and renounce his duty. Sti Krsna herein brings</p>
<p>our attention back to the battlefield when He says, hatva’pi</p>
<p>sa imal-lokan na hanti na nibadbyate — he who kills does</p>
<p>not actually kill and does not incur any reaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If Arjana abandons his duty as a warrior, then certainly</p>
<p>he will incur a karmic reaction for avoiding his duty. How-</p>
<p>ever, Arjuna will not actually ‘kil’ anyone in the truest</p>
<p>sense of the word, because the living beings arrayed before</p>
<p>him ready for battle are eternal parts and parcels of the</p>
<p>Supreme Person and thus eternal. The a#na can never be</p>
<p>‘killed’, And lastly, Arjana will not incur any karmic reac-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tion for doing his duty.</p>
<p>If one avoids one’s prescribed duties and renounces</p>
<p>them out of fear, bewilderment and so forth, then one</p>
