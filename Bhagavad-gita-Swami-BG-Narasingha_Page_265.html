<p>VERSE 34</p>
<p>मन्मना भव मद्धक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।</p>
<p>मामेवेष्यसि युक्त्यैवमात्मानं मत्परायणः ॥ ३४॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>man-mana bhava mad bhakto mad yaji marh namaskuru</p>
<p>mam evaisyast yuktvaivam atmanath mat-parayanab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Always think of Me. Be My devotee. Worship Me. Offer</p>
<p>your respects unto Me. In this way, by dedicating yourself to</p>
<p>Me and surrendering to Me, you will come to Me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important to note here that Sti Kysna says that He</p>
<p>is equal to all living beings. That is to say that Krsna has</p>
<p>no ‘chosen people’. Everyone is equal in His eyes as His</p>
<p>eternal parts and parcels. Krsna does not arbitrarily cause</p>
<p>one person to enjoy life and another to suffer. Enjoyment</p>
<p>and suffering are the results of one’s own pious or impious</p>
<p>activities in this life and in past lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When one approaches Krsna, He reciprocates directly</p>
<p>with that person. One does not have to be born in a pat-</p>
<p>ticular country, family, religion, caste, gender or tace to</p>
<p>approach Krsna. Nor is one first required to perform</p>
<p>certain pious activities such as penances or charity before</p>
<p>one can apptoach Him. The door is open to everyone and</p>
<p>Krsna reciprocates with each individual accordingly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But there is also no doubt that those who are deeply</p>
<p>devoted to Krsna and have taken shelter of Him com-</p>
<p>pletely, are very deat to Him and at the end of life they</p>
<p></p>
<p>will surely come to Krsna in His Supreme Abode.</p>
