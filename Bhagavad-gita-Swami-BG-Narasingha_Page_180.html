<p>Then one advances to the performance of pranayama,</p>
<p>controlling the inward and outward breath by systematic</p>
<p>breathing exercises performed in conjunction with vari-</p>
<p>ous asanas. When asanas and pranayama are performed</p>
<p>or taught just for the sake of health, this is sometimes</p>
<p>called hatha—yoga.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After pranayama follows pratyabara, or withdrawing</p>
<p>the senses from the sense-objects and training the mind to</p>
<p>become introspective and intuitively orientated. Then one</p>
<p>is able to concentrate the mind on a single point without</p>
<p>being disturbed. This is known as dharana, ot attaining</p>
<p>concentration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once having acquired the ability to concentrate the</p>
<p></p>
<p>mind without distractions from external sources, one can</p>
<p>begin actual meditation, or dhyana. There are many forms</p>
<p>of meditation in the Yoga system, however none of them</p>
<p>recommend concentrating on nothingness. The thtee prin-</p>
<p>ciple objects of meditation in yoga are Brahman (transcen-</p>
<p>dental light), Paramatma localised Super Consciousness)</p>
<p>and Bhagavan (Sti Krsna).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Samadbi is the final stage of astafiga~yoga wherein the</p>
<p>yogi, at the time of quitting the materia body, attains the</p>
<p>object of his desired perfection. The yogis who desire Brah-</p>
<p>man or Paramatma realisation enter the brabma-jfyoti after</p>
<p>giving up their body and the yogi who desires Bhagavan</p>
<p>realisation enters into the Supreme Abode of Krsna known</p>
<p>as Vaikuntha or Goloka Vrndavana to associate with and</p>
<p>participate in transcendental pastimes with Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to many masters of yoga, only Bhagavan real-</p>
<p></p>
<p>isation is eternal. Even after attaining Brahman or Para-</p>
<p>matméa tealisations and merging into the Supreme Brahman,</p>
