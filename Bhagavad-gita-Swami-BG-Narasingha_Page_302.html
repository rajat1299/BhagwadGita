<p>à¤— BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>pau lastyarh jayate 11/18 ka laya te karunyam atanvate</p>
<p>milecchan murchayate dasakrti-krte krsnaya tubbyarh namab</p>
<p></p>
<p>O Krsna, I offer my respects unto You, who appear</p>
<p>in the forms of these ten avataras. As Matsya You</p>
<p>rescue the Vedas, and as Karma You catty the Man-</p>
<p>dara Mountain on Your back. As Varaha You lift up</p>
<p>the Earth planet with Your tusks, and as Natasirnha</p>
<p>You teat open the chest of the daitya, Hitanyakasipu.</p>
<p>In the form of Vamana You delude the daitya king</p>
<p>Bali by requesting only three steps of land from him,</p>
<p>and then You take the whole universe from him by</p>
<p>expanding Your strides. As Paragurama You slay all</p>
<p>the wicked warriors, and as Ramacandta You fight</p>
<p>the raksasa king Ravana. As Balarama You carry a</p>
<p>plough with which You subdue the wicked and You</p>
<p>draw the River Yamuna towards You. As Buddha</p>
<p>You show compassion towards all the living beings</p>
<p>that are suffering in this world, and at the end of the</p>
<p>Kali-yuga You appear as Kalki in order to bewilder</p>
<p>the mlecchas. (Gita Govinda 1.12)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In reading the Bhagavad -gita one sees repetition in many</p>
<p></p>
<p>places. This however is not a flaw but an embellishment</p>
<p></p>
<p>due to ecstasy. The acarya Baladeva Vidyabhiisana con-</p>
<p>firms this (prasade vismaye barse dvi-trir-uk tar na dusyati)</p>
<p>as does the famous commentator on Bhagavad-gita A.C.</p>
<p>Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada, who writes in his pur-</p>
<p></p>
<p>port to verse nineteen as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences</p>
<p></p>
<p>of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in</p>
<p></p>
<p>GY 278 Ee</p>
