<p></p>
<p>It is said that it is imperceptible, inconceivable and immuta-</p>
<p>ble. Thus, understanding the nature of individual embod-</p>
<p>ied consciousness, it is inappropriate for you to lament.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrttt</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transcendental nature of consciousness has been</p>
<p>described in the above verses. It cannot be cut, burned or</p>
<p>even touched by water or ait. However, the material body</p>
<p>is subject to all the above. Consciousness is described as</p>
<p>eternal because it can never be destroyed. It is omnipresent</p>
<p>ecause it animates and gives feeling to all parts of the</p>
<p>ody. It is unchanging because it never becomes anything</p>
<p>other than what it is — pure consciousness. It is immovable</p>
<p>ecause it does not change its constitutional position. It is</p>
<p>primeval because it is the oldest of all. It is imperceptible</p>
<p>ecause it lies beyond the range of the physical senses. It is</p>
<p>inconceivable because it is beyond the speculative function</p>
<p>of the mind, and it is immutable because it is part and</p>
<p></p>
<p>parcel of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 26</p>
<p>अथ चैनं नित्यजातं नित्यं वा मन्यसे मृतम्‌ ।</p>
<p>तथापि त्वं महाबाहो नैनं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥२६॥</p>
<p>11.18 1 nitya-jatamh nityarh va manyase mrtam</p>
<p>tathapi tvarh maba-babo nainarh Socitum arbasi</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even if you believe that the individual consciousness</p>
<p>is eternally subject to birth and death, still you have no</p>
<p>reason to lament, O mighty-armed. one.</p>
