<p>अट CHAPTER 4 ABE</p>
<p></p>
<p>The point Sti Krsna wants to make clear is that actions</p>
<p>performed for His satisfaction do not have any reaction</p>
<p>in the sphere of karma or vikarma. Actions performed</p>
<p>for Krsna are in the category of akarma, producing only</p>
<p>spititual benefit — no good or bad material effect. Good</p>
<p>and bad karma are both material and as such they must</p>
<p>e shaken off before one can become spiritually liberated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally we want good karma, but good karma means</p>
<p>we will have to take birth again and enjoy its good effects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bad karma, of course, is commonly understood as some-</p>
<p>thing undesirable or to be avoided because it causes suffer-</p>
<p>ing, pain and distress. This is certainly trae, but bad karma</p>
<p>is simply the flip side of good karma and vice versa. This</p>
<p>is called the karmic entanglement of material life — some-</p>
<p>times enjoying and sometimes suffering.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Akarma leads to liberation from all material entangle-</p>
<p>ment and takes one to the plane of eternal blissful life in</p>
<p>full knowledge of everything. While engaging in yoga, a</p>
<p></p>
<p>serious student should, as fat as possible, lead a simple life</p>
<p></p>
<p>beyond dua ity by minimizing material hanketings, con-</p>
<p>trolling the mind and body and giving up possessiveness.</p>
<p>Being content with that which comes of its own accord,</p>
<p></p>
<p>one should remain steadfast in the practice of yoga.</p>
