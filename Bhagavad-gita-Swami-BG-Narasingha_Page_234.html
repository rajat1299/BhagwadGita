<p>At the time of death, one who remembers Him with</p>
<p>a steady mind by drawing the life-airs between the eye-</p>
<p>brows by dint of yogic power certainly reaches the Divine</p>

<p>Yoga and meditation are described herein. However,</p>
<p>they are not impersonal or self-centred processes. Medita-</p>
<p>tion is to be performed on the Absolute Truth, Sti Krsna —</p>
<p>not on abstract ideas that we ourselves are the sum total of</p>
<p>reality, that we are all-knowing ot that we are the supreme</p>
<p>controller etc. Such processes are not meditation, but</p>
<p>self-deception and never lead to liberation or eternal bliss.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse 10, Sti Krsna says that in yogic meditations</p>
<p>(astanga and kundalini-yoga) one should draw one’s life-</p>
<p>aits to the area of the eyebrows. This indicates the location</p>
<p>of the ajfia-cakra. There are seven cakras located in the</p>
<p>body that are the primaty seats of human consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness petvades the entire body, but is said to</p>
<p>be centred in one of the seven cakras — miiladbara-cakra</p>
<p>(located at the base of the genital), svadbisthana-cakra</p>
<p>(located at the base of the spinal cord), manipiira-cakra</p>
<p>(located in the navel area), anabata-cakra (located in the</p>
<p>heart), visuddba-cakra (located in the throat), ajfia-cakra</p>
<p></p>
<p>(located in between the eyebrows) and the sabasrara-cakra</p>
