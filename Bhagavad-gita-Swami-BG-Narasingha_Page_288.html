<p>is standing in front of him. Therefore, Krsna suggests to</p>
<p>Arjuna that he simply meditate on that form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no form of Krsna superior to that which was</p>
<p>standing in front of Arjana at Kuruksettra, save and except</p>
<p>for the form of Krsna when He appeated as a youth in the</p>
<p>forest of Vrndavana on the banks of the River Yamuna,</p>
<p>casting sidelong glances, His flute in hand and His tran-</p>
<p>scendental body bending in three places.</p>

<p>O friend, if you are attached to your companions</p>
<p>in this world, then do not gaze on the enchanting</p>
<p>smile of Govinda as He stands on the bank of the</p>
<p>‘Yamuna at Kesi-ghata. Casting sidelong glances, He</p>
<p>places His flute to His lips, which are compared to</p>
<p>newly blossomed buds. His divine body, bending in</p>
<p>three places, appears most effulgent in the light of</p>
<p>the moon. (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.22395;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna, appeared in Vyndavana, India, 5,237 years ago</p>
<p></p>
<p>and performed His pastimes of love with His devotees and</p>
<p></p>
<p>with those who had reached perfection through bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>The pastimes of Krsna in Vrndavana ate recorded in the</p>
<p>Tenth Canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam and have inspired</p>
<p></p>
<p>the students of bhakti-yoga for the past fifty centuries.</p>
<p>In the final chapter of Bhagavad -gita, Krsna will inform</p>
<p>Arjuna that whoever surrenders unto Him will attain the</p>
<p></p>
<p>Supreme Abode, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
