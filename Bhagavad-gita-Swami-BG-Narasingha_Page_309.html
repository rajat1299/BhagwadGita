<p>“yy CHAPTER 11 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>kaftci-dama sphuran-madbyarh nupurabbyarh lasat-padam</p>
<p>rati-keli-rasavesa-capalarh capa leksanam</p>
<p>basantarh priyaya sardhamn basayantarh ca tarh mubub</p>
<p>ittharn kalpa-taror mule ratna-sirnbasanopari</p>
<p>vrndaranye smaret krsnarh sarnsthitarh priyaya saba</p>
<p></p>
<p>I meditate on two-armed Krsna, who is dark like</p>
<p>a monsoon rain cloud, dressed in yellow garments,</p>
<p>garlanded with forest flowers, crowned with a pea-</p>
<p>cock feather and decorated with lotuses. His face</p>
<p>is as splendid as millions of moons and His eyes</p>
<p>move restlessly. His forehead is marked with tilaka</p>
<p>made of sandalwood paste and musk. He is adorned</p>
<p>with eattings that resemble two rising suns, and His</p>
<p>perspitation-anointed cheeks are like two glistening</p>
<p>mitrots. His eyes with raised eyebrows above them</p>
<p>playfully glance at His beloved’s face. The tip of His</p>
<p>graceful raised nose is decorated with a glistening</p>
<p>pearl. His lips are red like the bimba fruit and are</p>
<p>splendid in the moonlight of His teeth. His hands</p>
<p>are splendid with bracelets, armlets, and jewelled</p>
<p>rings. He holds a flute in His left lotus hand, His</p>
<p>waist is splendid with a ९५१८८ ful belt and His feet are</p>
<p>splendid with beautiful anklets. His eyes are rest-</p>
<p></p>
<p>less with the nectar of His divine activities and He</p>
<p>jokes with His friends, making them laugh again and</p>
<p>again. He sits on a jewelled throne under a desire</p>
<p>tree in the forest of Wrndavana with His beloved.</p>
<p>In this way one should meditate on Sti Krsna. (San-</p>
<p></p>
<p>at-kumara Sambita 54-62)</p>
