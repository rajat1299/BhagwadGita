<p>Anuvttti</p>

<p>One who acts whimsically never achieves happiness</p>
<p>ot perfection in this life or the next. One should there-</p>
<p>fore perform all austerities, sacrifice and acts of charity in</p>
<p>the mode of goodness as prescribed in Bhagavad -gita, for</p>
<p>passion and ignotance simply drag one down to the lower</p>
<p>stages of consciousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Herein, it is stated that in ancient times all acts and</p>
<p>injunctions of the Vedas were accompanied with the words,</p>
<p>om tat sat, indicating the Absolute Trath, the Supreme</p>
<p>Person, Sti Krsna. This ptactice however is no longer in</p>
<p></p>
<p>vogue in Kali-yuga. To the contrary, the real purpose of</p>
<p>human life is all but forgotten and people regrettably live</p>
<p>their lives aimlessly, eating, drinking and merrymaking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna has already said in Bhagavad-gita that what a</p>
<p>great man does, the common men will follow (yad yad</p>
<p>acarati Sresthas tat tad evetaro janab). Therefore, we call</p>
<p>upon all good-hearted men and women of the world</p>
<p>to hasten to the message of Bhagavad -gita and accept</p>
<p>Sti Krsna as the Supreme Person. Such a movement</p>
<p>in the world, under the banner of Bhagavad -gita, will</p>
<p>surely bring about the greatest fortune and well-being</p>
<p>of humanity. No greater good can be done than this and</p>
<p>there is no greater time for this than the present.</p>

<p>The most ideal literature is Bhagavad-gita, which</p>
<p>was sung by Sti Krsna, the son of Devaki. The</p>
