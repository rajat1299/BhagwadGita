<p>as a human being life after life, but this is not a fact. The</p>
<p>human form of life is only rarely achieved. It is not some-</p>
<p>thing that comes in rapid succession. Above and below the</p>
<p>homan species there are hundreds and thousands of other</p>
<p>life forms. Accord: ing to one’s activities performed in this</p>
<p>life and one’s final consciousness and state of mind at the</p>
<p>time of death, one’s next birth is determined.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the species below the human being, namely animal,</p>
<p>aquatic, insect and plant life, there is great ignorance and</p>
<p></p>
<p>suffering. Above the human plane there are higher planets</p>
<p>full of celestial beings and celestial pleasures. Yet higher or</p>
<p>lower, all stations of life in the material world are tempo-</p>
<p></p>
<p>raty. There is no place of eternal damnation and no place</p>
<p>of eternal happiness in the material universe. Nothing</p>
<p>in this world is everlasting. Only the abode of Krsna is</p>
<p>beyond the dualities of pleasure and suffering.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says above in verse 5, anta-kale ca mam eva</p>
<p>smaran muktva kalevaram — one who remembers Him at</p>
<p>the time of death attains His transcendental nature. To</p>
<p>remember Krsna at the end of life is indeed perfection, and</p>
<p>to forget Him is the greatest aberration. The Visnu-dhar-</p>
<p></p>
<p>mottara Purina states:</p>
<p></p>
<p>sa hanis tan mabac-chidram sa mobab sa ca vibbramab</p>
<p>yan mubirtarh ksanarn vapi vasudevo na cintayet</p>
<p></p>
<p>If even for a moment remembrance of Krsna is</p>
<p>missed, that is the greatest loss, the greatest 1[ण-</p>
<p>sion and the greatest anomaly. (Vispu-dharmottara</p>
<p></p>
<p>Purana 1.16)</p>
