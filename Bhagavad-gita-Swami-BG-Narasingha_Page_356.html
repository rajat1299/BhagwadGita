<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since time immemorial, man has inquired about the</p>
<p>origin of the living being. Who am I? Where have I</p>
<p>come from? How does the living being first appear in</p>
<p>this world? From what stage of spiritual existence does</p>
<p>be fall into the material world?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two classes of living beings who come</p>
<p>into this world. One class comes from the spiritual</p>
<p>Vaikuntha planets by the necessity of nitya-lila,</p>
<p>the eternal pastimes of Krsna. Another comes by</p>
<p>constitutional necessity. The brahma-jyoti, the non-</p>
<p>differentiated marginal plane, ts the source of infinite</p>
<p>living beings (Gjivatmas), atomic spiritual particles of</p>
<p>non-differentiated character.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rays of the transcendental body of the Supreme</p>
<p>Person are known as the brahma-jyoti, and a ray</p>
<p>of the brahma-jyoti is the jivatma. The jivatma is</p>
<p>an atom in that effulgence, and the brahma-jyoti és</p>
<p>a product of an infinite number of jivatma atoms.</p>
<p>Generally, jivatmas emanate from the brahma-jyoti</p>
<p>which is living and growing. Within the brahma-jyoti,</p>
<p>thetr equilibrium is somebow disturbed and movement</p>
<p>begins. From non-differentiation, differentiation</p>
<p>begins. From a plain sheet of uniform consctousness,</p>
<p>individual conscious units grow. And because the</p>
<p></p>
<p>jivatma is conscious it is endowed with free will.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the marginal position (tatastha-sakti) they</p>
<p>choose either the side of explottation (material world)</p>
<p>or the side of dedication (Vaikuntha). Krsna bhuli</p>

<p>bas no beginning. When we enter the land of exploita-</p>
