<p>VERSE 14</p>
<p>अन्नाद्धवन्ति भूतानि TAA: ।</p>
<p>यज्ञाद्भवति पज॑न्यो यज्ञः कर्म॑समुद्धवः ॥ ९४॥</p>

<p>All living beings subsist on food, and food is produced by</p>
<p>rain. Rain is produced due to the performance of sacrifice,</p>
<p>and sacrifice is born of prescribed activities.</p>

<p>In verse 10 Brahma is mentioned as the creator.</p>
<p>According to the Vedas, Brahma is the first living being in</p>
<p>this universe and is manifest directly by Visnu. Brahma’s</p>
<p>function is as the secondary creator of the planetary sys-</p>
<p>tems. In modern times, some atheistic thinkers, sach as</p>
<p>Professor Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist</p>
<p>from Oxford University, have conceded that aliens from</p>
<p>another planet may have possibly seeded life on Earth.</p>
<p>Far-fetched as this may sound to some of us, the idea does</p>
<p>come very close to the truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ancient texts of India state that Brahma resides</p>
<p>in the highest realm in the universe known as Satya-loka.</p>
<p>Some of the offspring of Brahma known as the Prajapatis</p>
<p>are then sent forth to seed life throughout the cosmos.</p>
<p>But rather than look at Brahma as an alien, the Vedic</p>
<p>texts describe him as the father of all living beings in the</p>
<p></p>
<p>material world.</p>
<p>Since western civilisation first came into contact with</p>
<p></p>
<p>the pantheon of Vedic demigods there has always been</p>
<p></p>
<p>the speculation that the Vedic people, often referred to</p>
