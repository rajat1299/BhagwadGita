<p></p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the Original Person, who is</p>
<p>playing His flute and has beautiful eyes like bloom-</p>
<p>ing lotus petals. His head is decorated with peacock</p>
<p>feathers, and His charming form, tinged with the</p>
<p>hue of rain clouds, is so alluring that it enchants</p>
<p></p>
<p>millions of Cupids. (Brabma-sambita 5.30)</p>

<p>I worship Govinda, the Original Petson, whose neck</p>
<p>is decorated with a garland of forest flowers that</p>
<p>swings to and fro. His hands, that hold His flute,</p>
<p>are adorned with jewelled bracelets. His threefold</p>
<p>bending form as Syamasundara is eternally manifest</p>
<p>as He enjoys His various pastimes of divine love.</p>

<p>I worship the Original Person, Govinda, who is</p>
<p>always meditated upon by those whose eyes are</p>
<p>anointed with the salve of divine love. His eternal</p>

<p>inconceivable qualities and He is always situated</p>
<p>within the hearts of His beloved devotees. (Brab-</p>
