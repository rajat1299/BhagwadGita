<p>Byam CHAPTER 13 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 30</p>
<p>प्रकृत्यैव च कर्माणि क्रियमाणानि सर्वशः |</p>
<p>यः परयति तथात्मानमकर्तारं स पश्यति ॥३०॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>prakrtyaiva ca karmani kriyamanani sarvasab</p>
<p>yah pasyati tathatmanam akartarath sa pasyati</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who realises that all activities are performed by mate-</p>
<p>rial nature, understands that he is not the doer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 31</p>
<p>सदा भूतपृथग्भावमेकस्थमनुपरूयति ।</p>
<p>तत एव च विस्तारं बह्म संपद्यते तदा ॥३१॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>yada bbuta-prthag-bhavam cka-stham anupasyati</p>
<p>tata eva ca vistararh brabma sampadyate tada</p>
<p></p>
<p>When one truly sees, he ceases to identify the body as the</p>
<p>self. Realising that all living beings are equal, he attains the</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brahman conception and sees them expanded everywhere.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p>The world is composed of moving and non-moving</p>
<p>things. Moving species consist of humans, animals, fish</p>
<p>etc. Non-moving objects include trees, mountains, miner-</p>
<p>als ete. Sti Kysna says that all these moving and non-mov-</p>
<p>ing things are a combination of material nature and the</p>
<p>living beings. One who has deeper vision sees that the</p>
<p>Super Consciousness is the Controller of all things and is</p>
<p>situated in the hearts of all living beings, within every atom</p>
<p>and in between every atom. Such a seer is a true knower</p>
<p>and realises that consciousness and Super Consciousness</p>
<p></p>
<p>ate both eternal and imperishable.</p>
