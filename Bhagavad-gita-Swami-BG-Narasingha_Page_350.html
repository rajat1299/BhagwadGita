<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although it seems that He is divided amongst all living</p>
<p>beings, He is in fact undivided. He is to be known as the</p>
<p>Creator, Maintainer and. Destroyer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 18</p>
<p>ज्योतिषामपि तज्योतिस्तमसः परमुच्यते |</p>
<p>ज्ञानंज्ञेयं ज्ञानगम्यं हृदि सर्वस्य विष्ठितम्‌ ॥ १८॥</p>
<p>fyotisam api taj jyotis tamasab paramucyate</p>
<p>fiianarh fileyarh jlana-gamyam brdi sarvasya visthitam</p>
<p></p>
<p>He is said to be the most brilliant of all luminaries, beyond</p>
<p>darkness. He is knowledge, the object of knowledge and</p>
<p>the aim of all knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 19</p>
<p>इति act तथा ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं चोक्तं समासतः |</p>
<p>मद्धक्त एतद्विज्ञाय मद्भावायोपपद्यते ॥ १९॥</p>
<p>iti ksetrarh tatha filanarh (निदा coktarh samasatab</p>
<p></p>
<p>mad-bhakta etad vijiaya mad-bhavayopapadyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus the field of activities, knowledge and the object of</p>
<p>knowledge have been briefly explained. By understanding</p>
<p>these, My devotee attains love for Me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Absolute Truth is known</p>
<p>in three phases of realisation — Brahman, Paramatma and</p>
<p>Bhagavan. The ‘He’ of whom Krsna speaks of in these</p>
<p>verses as being subordinate to Him, yet being the Supreme</p>
<p>Brahman refers to the Paramatma. His hands, feet, eyes and</p>
<p>ears are everywhere and He is situated in the hearts of all</p>
<p></p>
<p>living beings. He is all-pervasive throughout the universe,</p>
<p></p>
