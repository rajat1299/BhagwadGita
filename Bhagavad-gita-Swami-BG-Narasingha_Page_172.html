<p>VERSE 29</p>
<p>भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वरोकमदहेश्वरम्‌ ।</p>
<p>Ged सर्वभूताना ज्ञात्वा म शान्तिमृच्छति ॥२९॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>bhoktarath yaffia-tapasath sarva-loka-mahesvaram</p>
<p>subrdarh sarva-bbutanarh jfiatva math Santim rechati</p>
<p></p>
<p>One attains peace by knowing Me to be the original</p>
<p>enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Con-</p>
<p>troller of all the planets, and the benefactor and friend of</p>
<p>all living beings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrttt</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the last verse of this chapter Sti Krsna declares that</p>
<p>He is bhoktararit Yajfia-tapasam, the ultimate enjoyer and</p>
<p>receiver of all sacrifice and austerities. Krsna then says that</p>
<p>He is sarva-loka-mahesvaram, the Controller of all planets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some modern systems of yoga recommend that one med-</p>
<p>itate by thinking of oneself to be controlling and moving</p>
<p>the planets. This is completely absurd. When one is unable</p>
<p>to control the affairs of the world that surrounds him, how</p>
<p>then is he able to control the movements of the planets?</p>
<p>This is not actually meditation — it is self-deception.</p>
<p>Sti Kysna concludes by saying that He is subydam sar-</p>
<p>va-bbiitanam, the true friend of all living beings. By far,</p>
<p>the Krsna conception of the Absolute Truth is the broad-</p>
<p>est, most complete, in-depth and convincing idea of God</p>
<p></p>
<p>known to human society. There are many conceptions of</p>
<p></p>
<p>the ultimate source of life being the all-powerful creator</p>
<p>and controller of the universe, but the Krsna conception</p>
<p></p>
<p>is the only concept of ultimate reality that embraces a love</p>
<p></p>
<p>affair with God as a dear-most friend. This is exclusive</p>
