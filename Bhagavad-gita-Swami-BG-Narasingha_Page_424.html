<p>However, 0 best of the Bharata Dynasty, those sacrifices</p>
<p>that are performed out of pride and with selfish intent</p>
<p>should be considered to be in the mode of passion.</p>

<p>That sacrifice which disregards Vedic rules, where no food</p>
<p>is given in charity, which is without the chanting of proper</p>
<p>mantras and without charity to the brabmanas — such a</p>
<p>sacrifice is faithless and in the mode of ignorance.</p>

<p>For every age the Vedic literature recommends a par-</p>
<p>ticular sacrifice for those desiring self-realisation. It should</p>
<p>e noted that those sacrifices are never in the category of</p>
<p>lood sacrifice. In other words, those seeking self-realisa-</p>
<p>tion never perform animal or human sacrifice. Both animal</p>
<p>and human sacrifice have been practiced in many parts of</p>
<p>the world since ancient times, but at no time in history</p>
<p>have there been animal or human sactifices performed by</p>
<p>those seeking self-realisation in bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In today’s world, some religious sects sacrifice animals</p>
<p>efore eating them. Similar rituals are performed in other</p>
<p>sects wherein a symbolic representation of the blood and</p>
<p>ody of a saint are eaten. However, one should know that</p>
<p></p>
<p>all such barbaric activities are completely absent in the</p>
<p></p>
<p>practice of bhakti-yoga.</p>
