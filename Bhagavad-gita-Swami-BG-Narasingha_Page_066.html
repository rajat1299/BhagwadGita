<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is sometimes thought that God, ot some source of</p>
<p>higher intelligence, has created life in the universe, but</p>
<p>herein Sti Krsna expresses that the individual conscious-</p>
<p>ness of a iving being is never actually created. It exists eter-</p>
<p>nally as part and parcel of Krsna, as part and parcel of the</p>
<p>Super Consciousness. In the Vedic concept of the Abso-</p>
<p>lute Truth, Krsna exists eternally along with His enetgies.</p>
<p>Consciousness by that measure is never created; it simply</p>
<p>exists eternally as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The characteristics of consciousness are described as</p>
<p>unborn, eternal, indestructible and timeless — that which is</p>
<p></p>
<p>not destroyed when the body is destroyed. The effects of</p>
<p></p>
<p>time on the material body are perceived as growth, main-</p>
<p>tenance, by-products, old age, dwindling and death. But</p>
<p>consciousness, being transcendental to matter, transcends</p>
<p>time and therefore never grows old, dwindles or dies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In certain religious traditions the Creator is sometimes</p>
<p>visualised as being an old man in the sky. He is naturally</p>
<p>thought of as old because He has fathered the universe a</p>
<p>long time ago and He is the oldest of all. But here again</p>
<p>the conception of Bhagavad-gita differs dramatically. Con-</p>
<p>sciousness is ever fresh and the source of consciousness, the</p>
<p>Super Conscious Being, is always youthful and never old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who are engrossed in material affairs and who</p>
<p>ignore the wisdom of Bhagavad-gita will find it very diffi-</p>
<p>cult to overcome the bodily concept of life and understand</p>
<p></p>
<p>the difference between matter and consciousness.</p>
