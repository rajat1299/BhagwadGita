<p>अट CHAPTER 4 ABE</p>
<p></p>
<p>acaryarh mah vijaniyan navamanyeta harbicit</p>
<p>na martya-buddbyasnyeta sarva-deva-mayo gurub</p>
<p></p>
<p>One should consider the acarya (guru) as non-dif-</p>
<p>ferent from Myself and never show any disrespect</p>
<p>towards him. One should not envy him, nor con-</p>
<p>sider him to be an ordinary person as he is the rep-</p>
<p>resentative of all the demigods. (Srimad Bhagavatam</p>
<p>0/1</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the guru-disciple relationship that has been</p>
<p>accepted since time immemorial. However, the question</p>
<p>atises as to who is a guru? What are the qualifications of</p>
<p>a guru? It is clear that the disciple’s mood should be one</p>
<p>° f eagerness to know the truth accompanied by submissive</p>
<p>inquity and service. But what of the guru — what are his</p>
<p>qualifications?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita says that the guru must be one</p>
<p>who has seen the truth (a tattva-darst) and who knows</p>
<p>the science of Krsna consciousness. This presupposes</p>
<p></p>
<p>that the guru is himself a disciple of the previous guru.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is known as the guru-parampara or the guru-disci-</p>
<p>ple succession. Bhagavad-gita sets the standards to acquire</p>
<p>ntrance into knowledge of the Absolute Truth and what</p>
<p></p>
<p>€</p>
<p>that Truth is. Krsna is the principle speaker of the Bhaga-</p>
<p>vad-gita and therefore the gura must necessarily be in the</p>
<p>parampara of Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first qualification of the guru is that he must be</p>
<p>in an authentic parampara and he must teach his disciple</p>
<p>the principles and conclusions of Bhagavad-gita. There are</p>
<p></p>
<p>four paramparas and one should learn the philosophy of</p>
