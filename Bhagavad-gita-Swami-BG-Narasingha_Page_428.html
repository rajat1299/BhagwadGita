<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>in the modes of passion and ignorance — the results of</p>
<p>which ate temporaty and do not promote self-realisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Speaking truthfully, bat not in such a way as to offend</p>
<p>others, is known as verbal austerity. The saying is, ‘the</p>
<p>truth hurts’, but this does not apply to Bhagavad-gita. The</p>
<p>truth should be presented in such a way that it is attractive</p>
<p>and pleasing to hear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>satyarh brivyat priyath brayanna brivyat satyam-apriyam</p>
<p>priya ca nanrtarn brayad esa dharmab sanatanab</p>
<p></p>
<p>One should only speak the trath, and one’s speech</p>
<p>should be pleasing. One should not speak any trath</p>
<p>that offends and one should not speak any lie even</p>
<p>if it is pleasing — such is eternal dharma. (Manu-</p>
<p>sambita 4.138)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna is the friend and well-wisher of all living</p>
<p>beings and His message should be presented in that way.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita does not condemn — it simply points to that</p>
<p>which should be done and that which should not be done.</p>

<p>VERSE 20</p>
<p>दातव्यमिति दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे ।</p>
<p>देशो काले च पात्रे च तदान सात्तिकं स्मृतम्‌ ॥२०॥</p>
<p>datavyam iti yad danarh diyate’nupakarine</p>
<p>dese kale ca patre ca tad dinar sattvikarn smirtam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Charity that is given without any expectation of reward, at</p>
<p>a proper place, at an auspicious time, to a qualified recip-</p>
<p>ient with the mentality that it should be given, is in the</p>
<p>mode of goodness.</p>
