<p>अट CHAPTER 4 ABE</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Krsna hints at this ulti-</p>
<p>mate perfection eatly on in Bhagavad-gita, not too overtly</p>
<p>bat slightly covertly — for love, after all, is the greatest of</p>
<p>all secrets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In subsequent verses, Krsna continues to encourage</p>
<p>Arjuna not to adopt the path of imaction. Krsna assures</p>
<p>Arjuna that He is transcendental to all types of karma and</p>
<p>that those who take refuge in Him also become liberated</p>
<p>from the reactions of material activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kysna wants Arjuna to follow the example of pre-</p>
<p>viously iberated persons — to follow in their footsteps,</p>
<p>mabajano yena gatah sa panthab. In ancient times there were</p>
<p>many great personalities known as mabajanas and they all</p>
<p>achieved liberation from birth and death by taking shelter</p>
<p></p>
<p>of Krsna. Krsna wants Arjuna to follow these mabajanas.</p>
<p>Sti Krsna is awarding all living beings accordingly as</p>
<p></p>
<p>they approach Him. Knowingly or unknowingly everyone</p>
<p></p>
<p>is searching for Krsna. Krsna is the reservoir of pleasure</p>
<p>and the primeval cause of everything. In Brabma-sambita,</p>
<p>Sti Krsna is described as sarva-karana-karanam, the cause</p>
<p>of all causes. Krsna is also known as Govinda, or one who</p>
<p>gives pleasure to the senses. But due to being under the</p>
<p>illusion of bodily consciousness, the living beings are not</p>
<p>aware of what is actually in their best interest, therefore</p>
<p>they do not approach Krsna directly. Instead, the bewil-</p>
<p>dered living beings worship demigods for the fulfilnent</p>
<p>of their desires, or as in modern society, they simply work</p>
<p>hard to earn money and putchase whatever they want.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In material existence, the living beings are wandering</p>
<p>throughout the universe in different species of life, expe-</p>
<p>riencing happiness and distress according to their karma.</p>
