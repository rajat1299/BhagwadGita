<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p>This chapter of Bhagavad -gita is entitled Jiiana-Vijnana</p>
<p>Yoga. friana means knowledge of self as distinguished</p>
<p>from non-self, or knowledge that the self is not the body.</p>
<p>Vijfiana means tealised knowledge or tealisation of one’s</p>
<p>intrinsic telationship with Krsna. Srimad Bhagavatam also</p>
<p></p>
<p>mentions jfiana and vijfiana as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>jfanath parama gubyarh me yad vijnana-samanvitam</p>
<p>sa-rabasyarh tad ahgath ca grhana gaditarh maya</p>
<p></p>
<p>Knowledge (Gjfiana) about Krsna as described in the</p>
<p>Vedic literatures is very confidential, and it has to</p>
<p></p>
<p>be realised (vijfiana) in conjunction with the secrets</p>
<p></p>
<p>of devotion. (Srimad Bhagavatam 2.9.31)</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we speak of knowledge, modern man immedi-</p>
<p>ately thinks of scientific knowledge which he deems to</p>
<p>be most perfect. However, jfiana in Bhagavad-gita refers</p>
<p>to that knowledge of the self as distinguished from the</p>
<p>knowledge of matter or scientific knowledge. Knowledge</p>
<p>of matter is called apara—vidya and it is quite distinct</p>
<p>from the knowledge of the self in that it never leads to</p>
<p>self-realisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Rationalist movement, some</p>
<p>five centuries ago, science has completely rejected the idea</p>
<p>of consciousness as independent of matter. Many scientific</p>
<p>theories have been presented to explain the origin of the</p>
<p>universe and the origin of life such as the ‘Big Bang’ and</p>
<p>Darwinian Evolution, but these explanations remain mere</p>
<p>theories, lacking conclusive evidence.</p>
