<p>VERSE 28</p>
<p>शुभाद्ुम etd मोक्ष्यसे कर्मबन्धनैः |</p>
<p>संन्यासयोगयुक्तात्मा विमुक्तो मामुपैष्यसि ॥२८॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>Subbasubba-phalair evath moksyase karma-bandbanath</p>
<p>sannyasa-yoga~yuktatma vimukto mam upaisyasi</p>
<p></p>
<p>By doing so, you will become free from the bondage of</p>
<p>karma and it’s auspicious and inauspicious effects. By</p>
<p>renouncing the results of your actions and connecting</p>
<p>yourself with Me, you will become liberated and attain Me.</p>

<p>No one can live in this world without consuming</p>
<p>something. There are some yogis in India that try to avoid</p>
<p>entanglement with this material world to the extreme. To</p>
<p>this end they give up clothing, food and even water. But</p>
<p>ecause they do not recognise Krsna as the proprietor and</p>
<p>enjoyer of all things, they eventually fall down from their</p>
<p>position of false renunciation. We say ‘false renunciation’</p>
<p>ecause real renunciation means to renounce the idea of</p>
<p>oneself being the proprietor and enjoyer and to recognise</p>
<p>Kysna as the proprietor and the enjoyer of everything.</p>
<p>In the stage of real renunciation, one offers everything</p>
<p>first to Krsna and accepts only the remnants of such offer-</p>
<p>ings for his maintenance. The process of offering food to</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna by chanting appropriate mantras is to be learned</p>
<p></p>
<p>from the gura. When food is offered to Krsna by mantra</p>
<p>the food becomes ‘Krsnanised’. This is called prasadam, or</p>
<p>Kysna’s metcy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna says that if one offers Him with devotion</p>
<p></p>
<p>a leaf, flowers, fruits ot some water He will accept that.</p>
