<p>the Kali-yuga avatara, or the yugava tara. As the yugavatara,</p>
<p>Krsna taught the dharma of nama-sankirtana, the chant-</p>
<p>ing of the maba-mantra as not only the most important</p>
<p>process of self-realisation, but as the only recommended</p>
<p>process of self-realisation in Kali-yuga. Conclusively, the</p>
<p>Brhan-Naradiya Purana (38.126) says:</p>
<p></p>
<p>barer-nama barer-nama harer-nama eva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty-eva nasty-eva nasty-eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the age of Kali there is no other way, there is</p>
<p>no othet way, there is no other way except for the</p>
<p></p>
<p>chanting of the names of Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the maba-mantra is chanted congregationally in</p>
<p>a loud tone, it is called kirtana or sankirtana. When the</p>
<p>maba-mantra is chanted softly and the repetition is counted</p>
<p>ona string of one hundred-and eight beads, it is called japa.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the advent of Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the</p>
<p>sankirtana movement, many great and learned scholars,</p>
<p>philosophers and yogis such as Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya</p>
<p>and Prakagananda Sarasvati have put aside other systems</p>
<p>of yoga, Vedanta and philosophy in favour of becoming</p>
<p>fully absorbed in the chanting of the holy names of Krsna.</p>
<p>According to great self-realised petsonalities, the chanting</p>
<p>of the maba-mantra is the surest path to spiritual perfec</p>
<p></p>
<p>tion in this age. Srimad Bhigavatam states as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>kaler dosa nidhe rajann asti hy cko maban gunab</p>
<p>kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-satgab parath vrajet</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults where</p>
<p>people ate short-lived, slow and always disturbed,</p>
