<p>Sy CHAPTER 12 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout the Bhagavad-gita, Krsna’s statements are</p>
<p>consistent in that He repeatedly confitms that of all paths,</p>
<p>bhakti-yoga is the best. Among all types of yogis, jilanis,</p>
<p>philosophers and philanthropists, the bhakti-yogi who is</p>
<p>fully absorbed in Krsna without any material desires or the</p>
<p></p>
<p>desire for liberation, is the best and is very deat to Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>anyabbilasita-Sunyarh frana-karmady-anavrtam</p>
<p>anukulyena krsnanu-Slanarh bbhaktir-uttama</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the highest plane of bhakti-yoga one is devoid of</p>
<p>all material desires, material activities and the desire</p>
<p>for liberation. Such bhakti-yoga must be favoura-</p>
<p>bly performed according to Krsna’s desire. (Bhak-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ti-rasamrta-sindbu 1.1.11)</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is further confirmed by the greatest impersonal phi-</p>
<p>losopher of all time, Sripada Adi Sankara, who chastised</p>
<p>his disciples and told them that they should just worship</p>
<p>Krsna (Govinda). Nothing else is required.</p>
<p></p>
<p>bhaja govindarn bhaja govindarh bhaja govindarh mudha-mate</p>
<p>samprapte sannibite kale na hi na bi raksati dukrit karane</p>
<p></p>
<p>O foolish students, your repetition of grammatical</p>
<p>rules and your philosophical speculation will not</p>
<p>save you at the time of death. Just worship Govinda,</p>
<p>worship Govinda, worship Govinda! (Moba-mud-</p>
<p>gata 1)</p>
