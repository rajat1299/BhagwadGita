<p>Myf CHAPTER 18 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sacred conversation between Sti Kysna and Arjuna</p>
<p>ends with verse seventy-three wherein Arjuna says that his</p>
<p>delusion and doubts have all been dispelled. Thus Arjuna</p>
<p>agrees to follow Krsna’s instructions. This is the ideal</p>
<p>relationship between gura and disciple. The guru must</p>
<p>dispel the delusion and doubts of a disciple by delivering</p>
<p>the message of Sti Krsna found in Bhagavad-gita, without</p>
<p>change ot adulteration, and the disciple must be willing to</p>
<p>follow such instructions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The potency of hearing Krsna’s message is also con-</p>
<p>firmed in Srimad Bhagavatam as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sravatarn sva-kathab krsnab punya-Sravana-kirtanab</p>
<p>brdy-antab stho by-abbadrani vidbunoti subrt satan</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Kysna is the friend of the pious. He removes all</p>
<p>inauspiciousness from the heart of those who have</p>
<p>developed the desire to hear His message, which is</p>
<p>vittuous when properly heard and chanted. (Srimad</p>
<p>Bhagavatam 1.2.17)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Satijaya has been nattating the conversation between</p>
<p>Sti Krsna and Arjuna to Emperor Dhrtarastra and now he</p>
<p>expresses his own satisfaction and ecstasy. He says that</p>
<p>by remembering the words of Sri Krsna and by seeing His</p>
<p>beautiful form, he feels great ecstasy (brsya) and great</p>
<p>wonder (vistnaya). Satijaya then concludes with the bene-</p>
<p>diction that wherever thete is Sti Krsna, the Master of yoga,</p>
<p>and wherever there is Arjona, the sincere disciple, there will</p>
<p></p>
<p>always be prosperity, victory, opulence and righteousness.</p>
