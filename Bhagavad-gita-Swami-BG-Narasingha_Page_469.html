<p></p>
<p>to Vrndavana because Krsna performed wonder-</p>
<p>ful pastimes there and raised it with His left hand.</p>
<p>However, Radha-kunda is superior to Govardhana</p>
<p>because it is brimming with the nectar of divine love</p>
<p>for the Master of Gokula. Which intelligent person</p>
<p>will not render service to this place that is situated at</p>
<p></p>
<p>the feet of Govardhana? (Upadesamrta 9)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Supreme Abode of Krsna is the land of Veaja,</p>
<p>which includes Vindavana, Govardhana and Radha-kunda.</p>
<p>In verse 66, Sti Krsna indicates to Arjuna by the use of</p>
<p>the verb ‘vraja’ (meaning ‘to go’) that Arjuna will come</p>
<p>to Krsna in the topmost realm of the spiritual world. This</p>
<p>superior realm is also known as Goloka Vrndavana and is</p>
<p>described in Brabma-sambita as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>cintamani-prakara~sadmasu kalpa-vrksa-</p>
<p>laksavrtesu surabbir abbipalayantam</p>
<p>laksmnt-sabasra-Sata-sambhrama-sevyamanart</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusar tam abarh bhajami</p>
<p></p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the Original Petson, who is tend-</p>
<p>ing the cows, in that divine realm where the abodes</p>
<p>are built with touchstone. He is surrounded by mil-</p>
<p>lions of desire trees and is constantly served with</p>
<p>great care and attention by hundteds of thousands</p>
<p></p>
<p>of goddesses of fortune. (Brahma-sambita 5.29)</p>
