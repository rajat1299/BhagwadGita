<p>Sy CHAPTER 12 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are unable to do that, then do your work and offer</p>
<p>the results to Me. While controlling the mind, give up all</p>
<p>the results of your activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 12,</p>
<p>श्रयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाच्यानं विरिष्यते |</p>
<p>ध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्‌ ॥ १२॥</p>

<p>If you cannot follow this instruction then engage your-</p>
<p>self in the cultivation of knowledge. However, meditation</p>
<p>is superior to knowledge. Better than meditation is the</p>
<p>renunciation of material gain, for by such renunciation</p>
<p>one finds peace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga has two apptoaches, the direct and the</p>
<p>inditect. Sti Krsna tells Arjuna in verse 8 that the direct</p>
<p>approach is to, “Fix your mind and intelligence on Me</p>
<p>alone.” Such a stage is called raganuga-bhakti, or sponta-</p>
<p>neous devotion which is independent of the support of</p>
<p>tules and regulations. However, this stage of raganuga-</p>
<p>bhakti is not easily achieved, especially for beginners. In</p>
<p>that case Krsna recommends the indirect approach to</p>
<p>raganuga-bhakti which is the constant practice of rules and</p>
<p>regulations known as sadhana-bbakti. If such a practice is</p>
<p>not possible then Krsna suggests that one should work for</p>
<p>Him. If one cannot do that, then He says that one should</p>
<p>renounce the results of one’s activities and offer them to</p>
<p></p>
<p>Him. If one cannot do that, then one should engage in the</p>
<p></p>
<p>cultivation of knowledge to understand what the body is,</p>
