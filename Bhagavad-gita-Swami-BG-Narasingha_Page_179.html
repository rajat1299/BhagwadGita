<p>अ CHAPTER 6 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>For one who has subdued the mind, the mind is a friend.</p>
<p>However, for one who has not controlled the mind, the</p>
<p>mind is the greatest enemy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 7</p>
<p>जितात्मनः प्रशान्तस्य परमात्मा समाहितः ।</p>
<p>खीतोष्णसुख दुःखेषु तथा मानापमानयोः ॥७॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>jitatmanab prasantasya paramatma samabitah</p>
<p>Sitosna-sukba-dubkhesu tatha manapamanayob</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who have subdued the mind and are calm, attain</p>
<p>realisation of Paramatma (Super Consciousness). For such</p>
<p>persons heat and cold, happiness and distress and honour</p>
<p>and dishonour are all the same.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Many commentators on Bhagavad-gita have mentioned</p>
<p>that the method of meditation spoken of in the Sixth</p>
<p>Chapter is derived from the eightfold process of yoga</p>
<p>known as astafiga~yoga. The famous compiler of the Yoga-</p>
<p>siitras, Patanjali has explained the sequential order of the</p>
<p>astanga~yoga system as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, one should practice yama that consists of obser-</p>
<p>vances such as rising from bed before suntise, taking bath,</p>
<p>study of the Vedas and performing paja (rituals).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ntyama consists of contro, ling the senses by following</p>
<p>regulative ptinciples such as no intoxication, no illicit sex,</p>
<p>no gambling and no eating of meat, fish or eggs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next one begins the practice of asana by physically</p>
<p></p>
<p>conditioning the body through systematic bodily exercises</p>
<p>and postures aimed at toning and bringing into balance</p>
<p></p>
<p>one’s entire physical organism.</p>
