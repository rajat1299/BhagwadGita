<p>are the natural divisions in society and they are determined</p>
<p>by the quality of their work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunate y in modern India, this social system</p>
<p>described by Sti Krsna in the Bhagavad-gita has become</p>
<p>corrupted and is now known as the caste system which</p>
<p>determines one’s social status by birth. The caste system</p>
<p>is not actually the social system described in Bhagavad-gita</p>
<p>known as varnasrama-dbarma.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The caste system in India is certainly deplorable, hardly</p>
<p></p>
<p>better than that of slavery, because it limits a petson’s</p>
<p></p>
<p>potential accord ing to one’s birth. Krsna clearly states that</p>
<p>a person is to be known by his actions and not his pedigree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although social systems having intellectuals, adminis-</p>
<p>trators, mercantile and labout classes are found atound the</p>
<p>world, they are also not the same as the varnasrama system</p>
<p>mentioned in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to being an intellectual, a brabmana must</p>
<p>know what is Brahman. A ksatriya must do more than just</p>
<p>administrate and fight battles — he must be above corrup-</p>
<p>tion, give protection to the people and protect the ptin-</p>
<p>ciples of dharma found in Bhagavad-gita. And above all, a</p>
<p>ksatriya is never to be an aggressor — he is never to invade</p>
<p>a sovereign countty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The duty of a vatsya, in addition to business, is farm-</p>
<p>ing and cow protection. Naturally, the purpose of busi-</p>
<p>ness is to earn a living, but nowadays this has gone far</p>
<p>beyond actual necessity as per the advice of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Simple business has turned into massive industry — the</p>
<p>establishing of mega multi-national corporations, money</p>
<p>hoarding and fractional banking. ‘These in turn have led to</p>
<p></p>
<p>the corruption of government officials around the world</p>
