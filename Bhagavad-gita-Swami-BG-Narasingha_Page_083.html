<p>अ CHAPTER2 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>fulfil all of one’s desires (prakamya-siddhi) and the ability</p>
<p>to assume any form one wishes (kamavasayita-siddbi). As</p>
<p>the Master of yoga, Krsna has these eight yoga perfections</p>
<p>in full.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is sometimes claimed by yogis that they have achieved</p>
<p>one or more of these asta-siddbis and such seems to have</p>
<p>been relatively common in ancient times. But in modern</p>
<p>times the claim of having one of the asta~siddhis, more often</p>
<p>than not, turns out to be fraudulent or simply a show to</p>
<p>attract many followers. With the tise in popularity of yoga,</p>
<p>false claims of asta-siddbis have become a lucrative business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A higher aspitation for the yogi is not the achievement</p>
<p>of the asta~siddhis, but the achievement of samadbi in bhak-</p>
<p>ti-yoga because such achievement frees one from the cycle</p>
<p></p>
<p>of birth and death.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: O KeSava, what are the characteristics of that</p>
<p>person who is perfectly situated in divine wisdom and fully</p>
<p>absorbed in pure spiritual consciousness (samadhi)? How</p>
<p></p>
<p>does he speak? How does he sit? How does he walk?</p>
