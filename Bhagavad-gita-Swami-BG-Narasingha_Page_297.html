<p>“yy CHAPTER 11 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>is not possible to perceive with the eyes of this material</p>
<p>body. For such a vision as Arjana was to receive, one needs</p>
<p>divine eyes. In other words, Arjuna’s vision of the universal</p>
<p>form was subjective and could only be revealed by Krsna.</p>
<p>Within that vision Arjuna was able to see in one place</p>
<p>all that is, all that was, all that will ever be, everything</p>
<p>moving and non-moving in an instant. As we will see in</p>
<p></p>
<p>this chapter, after seeing the universal form of Krsna which</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjana describes as wonderful, astonishing, fiery, terrible</p>
<p>and devastating, he becomes fearful and asks Krsna to once</p>
<p>again show him His charming and beautiful form as the</p>
<p>Supreme Person.</p>
