<p>When consciousness is situated in the lower three cakras</p>
<p>one is found to be preoccupied with the animal tendencies</p>
<p>of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. When con-</p>
<p>sciousness is situated in the upper cakras there is progress</p>
<p>in the finer sentiments of spiritual culture and ultimately</p>
<p>liberation. Consciousness is raised in meditation from one</p>
<p>cakra to another through the subtle passage in the body</p>
<p>known as the susumna—nadi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says that the yogi should bring his consciousness</p>
<p>to be seated in the ajfia-cakra, sometimes known as the</p>
<p>‘third eye’. Here the yogi makes his or her final preparation</p>
<p>and at last raises the consciousness through the susumna-</p>
<p>nadi to the sabasrara-cakra and from there the yogi quits the</p>
<p>material body. If the astaga-yogi or kundalini-yogt makes</p>
<p>Sti Kysna the object of his meditation while concentrating</p>
<p>on the ajfia-cakra, then after passing the sabasrara-cakra,</p>
<p>the yogi achieves Krsna’s Supreme Abode. However, if the</p>
<p>said yogi does not make Sti Krsna the object of his medita-</p>
<p>tion, then he may enter the brabma—jfyoti for sometime, but</p>
<p>eventually he returns to this material world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The aforementioned processes of yoga take superhu-</p>
<p>man endeavour and for the most part are not possible for</p>
<p>the avetage person to achieve in this age. Astafga—yoga</p>
<p>and kundalini~yoga must be practiced in absolute seclu-</p>
<p>sion from society, observing complete celibacy and fasting</p>
<p>for long periods. In ancient times such yogis went to the</p>
<p>mountain caves of the Himalayas or to the deserts. Today’s</p>
<p>yogis in modern yoga studios and societies are unable to</p>
<p>raise their consciousness through the cakras to the sabas-</p>
<p>rara-cakra because they lack the solitude and severe deter-</p>
<p>mination required. Therefore, Bhagavad-gita conclusively</p>
