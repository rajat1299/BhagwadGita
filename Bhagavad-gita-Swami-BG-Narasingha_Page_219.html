<p>However, the results achieved by such persons of little</p>
<p>intelligence are temporary. Those who worship the dem-</p>
<p>igods reach them, but My devotees attain Me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p>Surrender to Sti Krsna may not be achieved in one</p>
<p>lifetime. In fact Krsna says that after many lifetimes of</p>
<p>acquiting knowledge one ultimately surrenders unto Him</p>
<p>knowing Vasudeva (Krsna) to be the source of all that be.</p>
<p>Indeed such persons are very rate — sa mabatna sudurlabbab.</p>
<p>Mabatma literally means a great personality or devotee</p>
<p>of Krsna, but one does not become a mabatma simply by</p>
<p></p>
<p>‘rabber stamping’. There are required qualities and only</p>
<p></p>
<p>those who manifest such qualities should be respected</p>
<p>as a mabatma. These qualities are mentioned in Caitan-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ya-caritamrta as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>krpalu, akrta-droba, satya-sara sama</p>
<p>nidosa, vadanya, mrdu, Suci, akificana</p>
<p>sarvopakaraka, Santa, krsnaika-Sarana</p>
<p>akama, antha, stbira, vijita-sad-guna</p>
<p>mita-bbuk, apramatia, manada, amani</p>
<p>gambbira, karuna, maitra, kavi, daksa, maunt</p>
<p></p>
<p>Devotees of Sti Kysna are always merciful, humble,</p>
<p>णण, and equal to all, faultless, magnanimous,</p>
<p>mild and clean. They are without material posses-</p>
<p>sions, and they perform welfare work for everyone.</p>
<p>They ate peaceful, surrendered to Krsna and without</p>
<p>desire. They are indifferent to material acquisitions</p>
