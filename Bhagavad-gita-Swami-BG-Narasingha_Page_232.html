<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, it is our experience of the world that death</p>
<p>is often accompanied by great pain, confusion and bewil-</p>
<p>derment of memory. Therefore, it would seem that to</p>
<p>remember Krsna at the time of death is no easy task. Death</p>
<p>may come swiftly at any time, without a moments notice</p>
<p>or even during sleep, thus impeding one’s remembrance of</p>
<p>Krsna. In this regard Kalagekhara Alvar writes in Mukun-</p>
<p>da-mala Stotram as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>krsna tvadiya-pada-pankaja-pafijarantam</p>
<p>adyaiva me visatu manasa-raja-barhsab</p>
<p></p>
<p>prana-prayana-samaye kapha-vata-pittaih</p>
<p></p>
<p>kanthavarodbana-vidhau smaranari kutas te</p>
<p></p>
<p>0 Krsna, please help me die quickly so the swan</p>
<p>of my mind may become encircled by the stem of</p>
<p>Your lotus feet. Otherwise at the time of my final</p>
<p>reath, when my throat is choked up, how will it be</p>
<p>possible for me to think of You? (Mukunda-mala</p>
<p>Stotram 33)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the bhakti-yogi Krsna takes all his many endeavours,</p>
<p>practices and services into consideration. Even if the bhak-</p>
<p>ti-yogi is unable to remember Krsna at the time of death,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kysna will certainly remember him. Sri Krsna is never for-</p>
<p></p>
<p>getful under any circumstance and thus He swiftly delivers</p>
<p>His devotee from the clutches of death. Krsna Himself</p>
<p></p>
<p>confirms this in the Varaba Purana as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>yadi vitadi-dosena mad bhakto math ca na smaret</p>
<p>abarh smarami mad bhaktab nayami paramarh gatim</p>
