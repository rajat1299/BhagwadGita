<p>“yy CHAPTER 10 AR</p>
<p></p>
<p>Manus in one day of Brahma. These Manus are progeni-</p>
<p>tors of mankind that populate life throughout the universe.</p>
<p>All these personalities manifest from the mind of Krsna</p>
<p>and appear in the material world as the sons of Brahma.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are all wonderful activities and cannot be under-</p>
<p>stood by ordinary people. Only Krsna’s most confiden-</p>
<p>tial devotee can understand His true nature. Such 3 yogi is</p>
<p>free from duality, is united with Krsna and sees Him in all</p>
<p>things as the Absolute Truth. Krsna assures us that of this,</p>
<p>there is no doubt.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Tam the source of everything. All things emanate from Me.</p>
<p>Understanding this, the wise who are endowed with love,</p>
<p>worship Me with all their heart.</p>
<p></p>

<p>kathayantas ca mar nityarh tusyanti ca ramanti ca</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who are always thinking of Me, who have dedicated.</p>
<p>their lives to Me, enlighten each other and feel great satis-</p>
<p>faction and joy by always speaking about Me.</p>
