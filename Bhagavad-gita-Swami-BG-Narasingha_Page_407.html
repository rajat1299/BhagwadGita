<p>Bye CHAPTER 16 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>from danger — not just from the danger of an invading</p>
<p>army, but also from the threat of unwholesome ideolo-</p>
<p>gies that may destroy a civilisation from within. Unfor-</p>
<p>tunately, it seems as though governments worldwide have</p>
<p>abandoned all sense of proper behaviour and they them-</p>
<p>selves have become the leading plunderers of the people.</p>
<p>Amassing wealth by any means and depriving the people</p>
<p>from even the most basic necessities of life, such despots</p>
<p>know no shame. Indeed, the world is in a petiod of great</p>
<p>darkness at the hands of the asura mentality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From their high pulpits the heads of state declare, “Our</p>
<p>enemies must be killed. The evildoers must be defeated.</p>
<p>We shall be victorious, we shall rale the world, we shall</p>
<p>enjoy, we ate the chosen people, we are powerful, we are</p>
<p>happy and none are our equals!” And while the hysteria of</p>
<p>the masses runs wild, the innocent ate sent to their gtaves</p>
<p>and the Earth weeps for her children. Yet it seems we are</p>
<p></p>
<p>unfazed. Such, Krsna says, is our ignorance.</p>

<p>VERSE 16</p>
<p>अनेकचित्तविश्रान्ता मोहजालसमावृताः ।</p>
<p>प्रसक्ताः कामभोगेषु पतन्ति नरकेऽशुचौ ॥ ९६॥</p>
<p>aneka-citta-vibbranta moba-jala-samavrtab</p>
<p>prasaktab kama-bbogesu patanti narake’ sucau</p>
<p></p>
<p>The minds of the asuras are full of various bewildering</p>
<p>thoughts and thus they are ensnared in a network of illu-</p>
<p>sion. As they become absorbed in fulfilling their mundane</p>
<p>desires, they descend into a foul abyss.</p>
