<p>Bye CHAPTER 14 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>wise, considering infamy and honour the same and has no</p>
<p>enemies, as he is impartial to both friends and foes. These</p>
<p>are the characteristics of one who is transcendentally sit-</p>
<p>uated above the three modes of material nature. Srimad</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavatam confirms this in the following way:</p>
<p></p>
<p>sattvikah karako ‘sangt ragandho rajasab smrtab</p>
<p>tamasab smrti-vibbrasto nirguno mad-apasrayab</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who works free of attachment is in the mode</p>
<p>of goodness. One who works with personal desire</p>
<p>is in the mode of passion. One who works without</p>
<p>discrimination of right and wrong is in the mode</p>
<p>of ignorance. But one who takes shelter of Krsna</p>
<p>is understood to be transcendental to the modes of</p>
<p>material nature. (Srimad Bhagavatam 11.25.26)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The liberated person is always situated in bhakti-yoga</p>
<p>without deviation because he knows Sti Krsna as the</p>
<p>immortal, imperishable Brahman, the giver of eternal</p>
<p>wisdom in the form of Bhagavad-gita and the fountainhead</p>
<p></p>
<p>of supreme bliss.</p>
