<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Happiness that arises from sleep, laziness and delusion and</p>
<p>is self-deceptive in both the beginning and the end is con-</p>
<p>sidered to be happiness in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 40</p>
<p>न तदस्ति पृथिव्यां वा दिवि देवेषु वा पुनः |</p>
<p>सत्व HBAS यदेभिः SURAT: ॥४०॥</p>
<p>na tad asti prthivyarh vadivi devesu va punab</p>
<p>sattvarh prakrti-jair muktarh yad ebbib syat tri-bbir gunaib</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no living being, neither on Earth nor amongst</p>
<p>the celestial beings, that is free from these three modes of</p>
<p></p>
<p>material nature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everyone and everything in the material world is gov-</p>
<p>erned by the three modes of material nature. In the truest</p>
<p>sense of the word, there is no meaning of freedom or inde-</p>
<p>pendence unless one is free from the modes of nature. All</p>
<p>such celebrations in the name of political emancipation</p>
<p>are merely another form of self-deception. Where is the</p>
<p>question of freedom when out every action is controlled by</p>
<p>nature and we are being pushed down the highway of life</p>
<p>to face ultimate death?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Independence from the three modes of material nature</p>
<p>is only afforded to those who have taken shelter of a bona-</p>
<p>fide gard, who have understood the knowledge of Bhaga-</p>
<p>vad-gita and have applied themselves to bhakti-yoga. Only</p>
<p>the bhakti-yogi can truly celebrate freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna says that happiness in the mode of good-</p>
<p>ness is bitter in the beginning, but nectar in the end. This</p>
