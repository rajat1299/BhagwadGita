<p>Bye CHAPTER 17 व</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saintly persons are liberated from all types of impi-</p>
<p>ety by accepting the remnants of foodstuffs offered</p>
<p>in sactifice (to Krsna). However, those who only</p>
<p>cook for themselves perpetuate their own bondage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Food that is to be offered to Krsna must be prepared</p>
<p>with love and devotion, and in a kitchen that is clean and</p>
<p>where domestic pets such as cats and dogs do not enter.</p>
<p>Everyone loves their pets — indeed, Sti Krsna Humself</p>
<p>loves His two pet dogs, Vyaghra and Bhtamataka, as well</p>
<p>as other animals. However, pets should not be allowed in</p>
<p>the kitchen where offerings are prepared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The student of bhakti-yoga should not be a fanatic, but</p>
<p>should practice moderation in all things. However, the</p>
<p>yogi should be diligent to avoid food in the modes of pas-</p>
<p></p>
<p>sion and ignorance.</p>

<p>अफलाकङ्गिभियंज्ञो विधिदृष्टो य इज्यते |</p>
<p>यष्टव्यमेवेति मनः समाधाय स सात्विकः ॥ ११॥</p>

<p></p>
<p>yastavyam eveti manab samadhaya sa sattvikab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sacrifices that are resolutely performed according to Vedic</p>
<p>injunctions, by those who have no desire for any personal</p>
<p>gain are said to be in the mode of goodness.</p>

<p>VERSE 12</p>
<p>अभिसंधाय तु फट दम्भार्थमपि चैव यत्‌ ।</p>
<p>इज्यते भरतश्रेष्ठ तं यज्ञं विद्धि राजसम्‌ ॥ १२॥</p>
