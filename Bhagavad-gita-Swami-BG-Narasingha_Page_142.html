<p>VERSE 22</p>
<p>यदृच्छालाभसंतुष्टो दंदातीतो विमत्सरः |</p>
<p>समः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निवध्यते ॥२२॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>11111 11.</p>
<p>samab siddbav-asiddhau ca krtvapi na nibadbyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who is content with those things that come of their</p>
<p>own accord, who is beyond duality, devoid of enviousness,</p>
<p>and equal in success and. failure — such a person is not</p>
<p></p>
<p>bound by karma, although he may perform actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 23</p>
<p>गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः |</p>
<p>यज्ञायाचरतः कमम समगर मरविरीयते ॥२३॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>gata-sangasya muktasya fiandvasthita-cetasab</p>
<p>yajitayacharatah karma samagrarh praviliyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>All karma is completely dissolved for one who is</p>
<p>detached, liberated, situated in knowledge and performs</p>
<p>action only in sacrifice.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>We have already discussed previously the different types</p>
<p>of action such as karma (prescribed duties), vikarma (for-</p>
<p>bidden actions) and akarma (spiritual activities). None-</p>
<p>theless it is sometimes difficult to understand the different</p>
<p>types of action, and especially to see inaction im action</p>
<p>and action within inaction. Indeed, this seems quite con-</p>
<p>tradictory. In contemporary society, especially in various</p>
<p>Yoga communities, karma is often spoken of without a clear</p>
<p>understanding of what it actually is or how it is incurred.</p>
