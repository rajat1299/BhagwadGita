<p>अट CHAPTER 4 ABE</p>
<p></p>
<p>atma awakens to its real inner treasure — a life of</p>
<p>love with Krsna. Again and again tasting nectar, the</p>
<p>atma dives and surfaces in the ever-increasing ocean</p>
<p>of ecstatic joy. All phases of the self of which we</p>
<p>may conceive are fully satisfied and putified, and at</p>
<p>last conquered by the all-auspicious influence of the</p>
<p></p>
<p>holy name of Krsna. (Siksastaka 1)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught the chanting of the</p>
<p>maba-mantra and a complete system of philosophy known</p>
<p>as acintya-bhedabheda-tattva that has encompassed all the</p>
<p>great philosophical systems of India that preceded Him,</p>
<p>such as Adi Sankara’s advaita, Visnu Svami’s suddbadvaita,</p>
<p>Nimbarka’s dvaitadvaita, Ramanuja’s visisthadvaita and</p>
<p>Madhva’s dvaita. The acintya-bhedabheda-tattva philoso-</p>
<p>phy is essentially the philosophy of simultaneous oneness</p>
<p>and difference in the Absolute Trath, culminating in pre-</p>
<p>ma-bbakti or divine love. As sach, Sti Caitanya Mahaprabhu</p>
<p>has revealed the greatest philosophy of spititual perfection</p>
<p>in this world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To accompany the chanting of the maba-mantra the</p>
<p>process of Deity worship that was prominent in Dvapa-</p>
<p>ra-yuga is still in vogue today. The Deity is the arca~vi-</p>
<p>graha representation of Sti Krsna that is manifest before</p>
<p>the aspirant so that one can perform arcana (worship)</p>
<p>and fix the mind and senses on the form of the Supreme</p>
<p>Person. When the authorised arca-vigraha is present, sach</p>
<p>worship should not be confused with the worship of life-</p>
<p>less and unauthorised idols. Current in the communities</p>
<p>of bhakti-yoga are the worship of the arca-vigrabas of Sti</p>
<p>Krsna such as Jagannatha, Pafica-tattva, Gaura-Nitai, Gau-</p>
<p>ra-Gadadhara, Sti Narasirnha and Sti Sri Radha-Krsna.</p>
