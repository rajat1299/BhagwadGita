<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says that food that is stale, tasteless, foul smell-</p>
<p>ing, rotten, left behind by others ot unfit for sacrifice, is</p>
<p>food in the mode of ignorance. Food left behind by others</p>
<p>means the sctaps left behind on someone’s plate, that in</p>
<p>western countries, are usually fed to dogs and cats. Food</p>
<p>not fit for sacrifice means that food contaminated by an</p>
<p>animal, or that has come in contact with something filthy</p>
<p>and impute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Food in the mode of ignorance may include some veg-</p>
<p>etatian food that has become contaminated. Food in the</p>
<p>mode of ignotance generally pertains to all varieties of</p>
<p>non-vegetatian foodstuff such as meat, fish and eggs. These</p>
<p>include beef, mutton, goat, pig. chicken, venison, turkey,</p>
<p>duck, turtle, prawn, crab, frog, insect, snake, clam, oyster,</p>
<p>shark, whale, caviar, horse and dog, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Absurd as it may sound to the student of bhakti-yoga, all</p>
<p>the food mentioned above is very popular in various parts</p>
<p>of the world. Such food is to be avoided by all classes of</p>
<p></p>
<p>yogis, as well as by progressive human beings in general.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All types of yogis prefer food in the mode of goodness,</p>
<p>but the bhakti-yogis prefer to eat only the remnants of food</p>
<p></p>
<p>in the mode of goodness that has first been offered to Sti</p>
<p>Kysna with love and devotion (yo me bhaktya prayacchati).</p>
<p>Such remnants are called prasadam or maba-prasadam.</p>
<p>Even eating food in the mode of goodness catries a</p>
<p>karmic reaction if it is not first offered to Krsna. This</p>
<p>has also been mentioned in Bhagavad-gita, Chapter Three,</p>
<p></p>
<p>verse 13 as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>yajita-SistaSinab santo mucyante sarva-kilbisaib</p>
<p>bhufijate te tvagharh papa ye pacanty-atma-karanat</p>
<p></p>
