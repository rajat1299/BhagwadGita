<p>Byam CHAPTER 13 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>He divides Himself to be within all things, yet He Himself</p>
<p>is not divided or diminished — He remains the Complete</p>
<p>Petson. This is stated in the invocation of the Ifopanisad</p>
<p></p>
<p>as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>ort purnam adab purnam idarh purnat purnam udacyate</p>
<p>purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Supreme Person is perfect and complete, and</p>
<p>because He is completely perfect, all emanations</p>
<p>from Him, such as this material world, are also</p>
<p>perfect and complete. Whatever emanates from the</p>
<p>Complete Person is also complete in itself. Because</p>
<p>He is the Complete Person, even though so many</p>
<p>complete units emanate from Him, He remains the</p>
<p></p>
<p>complete balance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt would seem that the discourse between the theist and</p>
<p>the atheist is perpetually in a gridlock. But as mentioned</p>
<p>in a previous Anuvrtti, the student of Bhagavad-gita does</p>
<p>not consider either the so-called theist or the atheist to</p>
<p>have complete knowledge. It may even be that sometimes</p>
<p>the atheist is more correct in his opinion than the so-called</p>
<p>theist. The theist establishes his God, and the atheist, upon</p>
<p>examining the statements of the so-called theist, discovers</p>
<p></p>
<p>that the God in question is wrathfal, vindictive, jealous,</p>
<p></p>
<p>venge ful, sadomasochistic etc. In this instance we would</p>
<p></p>
<p>have to agree with the atheist — there is no such God.</p>
<p>However, the atheist then concludes that in the absence</p>
<p></p>
<p>of God, the universe and all life within it has come from</p>
<p></p>
<p>nothing —yet he has no experience or proof that something</p>
<p></p>
<p>can 31156 from nothing. His proposal is thus self-defeating.</p>
