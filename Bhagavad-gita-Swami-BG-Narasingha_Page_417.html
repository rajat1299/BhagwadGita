<p>Bye CHAPTER 17 व</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this chapter Sti Krsna answers the question of Arjuna</p>
<p>regarding those who reject the Vedas, but perform worship</p>
<p>with some faith. Arjuna wants to know to which mode of</p>
<p>material nature they belong. The first lesson to learn here</p>
<p>is that by not following the Vedic injunctions one auto-</p>
<p>matically acts as one likes, but is henceforth always under</p>
<p>the modes of matetial nature — goodness, passion and</p>
<p>ignorance. Thus, one is never situated in transcendence.</p>
<p>Sti Krsna then further describes food, sacrifice, austerity</p>
<p>and charity as they ate influenced by, ot born of, the three</p>
<p>modes of material nature.</p>
<p>First faith (¢raddha) is discussed. Sti Krsna tells Arjuna</p>
<p>that sraddba arises in this life due to one’s own nature and</p>
<p>from imptessions in the mind from previous lives. A</p>
<p>activities in life depend on faith to one degree or another.</p>
<p>It does not matter what one’s creed may be — theist or</p>
<p>atheist, one must have faith. The theist has faith that there</p>
<p>is a God, and the atheist has faith that there is no God. If</p>
<p>one states a particular doctrine ot philosophy, bat says he</p>
<p></p>
<p>has no ‘faith’ then that is pure hypocrisy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says that when one’s faith is in the mode of</p>
<p>goodness, one worships the demigods such as (2911663,</p>
<p>Siva, Siirya, Indta and Sarasvati etc. When one’s faith is in</p>
<p>the mode of passion, one worships the spirits in nature or</p>
<p>the ancestors — this also includes humanists and atheists.</p>
<p>When one’s faith is in the mode of ignorance, one is found</p>
<p>to worship ghosts and spirits. All these types of worship</p>
<p>are current in the world today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In India, many people worship the demigods by building</p>
<p></p>
<p>big temples and offering fire sactifices known as yajftas. In</p>
