<p>yatravatirnath krsnakbyarh</p>
<p>pararn brabma narakrtim</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the Supreme Person descends in His human-</p>
<p>like form, He is Krsna, the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>(Visau Purana 4.11.2)</p>
<p></p>
<p>tasmat krsna eva paro devas tatit dhyayet</p>
<p>tart raset tarh bhajet tarh yajet</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus Krsna is the Supreme Person. One should</p>
<p>meditate on Him. One should delight in Him. One</p>
<p>should worship Him and make offerings to Him.</p>
<p>(Gopala-tapani Upanisad 1.54)</p>
<p></p>
<p>krsir bbii-vacakab sabdo nas ca nirvrti-vacakab</p>
<p>tayor aikyarh pararh brabma krsna ityabbidbtyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>The verbal root krs refers to the all-attractive quality</p>
<p>of Krsna, and the syllable wa refers to His spiritual</p>
<p>bliss. When ks is added to the affix na, it becomes</p>
<p>the word Krsna, indicating the Supreme Truth.</p>

<p>Arjuna has become overwhelmed with compassion for</p>
<p></p>
<p>those who ate about to die on the battlefield. In fact, such</p>
<p>is his grief that he himself is prepared to die rather than</p>
<p>kill his enemies. But Arjuna is a warrior and from a noble</p>
<p>family, therefore Krsna advises Arjuna against his weakness</p>
<p>of heart. If one is a warrior it is one’s duty to face the enemy</p>
<p>and not cower away. Fighting is indeed a nasty business,</p>
<p>bat when duty calls, such fighting may be unavoidable. In</p>
<p></p>
<p>ancient times, acts of aggression were abhotted and strictly</p>
