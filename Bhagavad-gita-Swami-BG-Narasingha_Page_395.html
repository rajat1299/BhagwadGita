<p>Bye CHAPTER 15 ey</p>
<p></p>
<p>will be, the Supreme Person. This is the declaration found</p>
<p>in Bhagavad-gita and throughout the Vedic literature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ekale tSvara krsna ara saba bhrtya</p>
<p>-yare yaiche nacaya se taiche kare nrtya</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna alone is the Supreme Controller. All others</p>
<p>are His setvants. They dance as He makes them do</p>
<p>50. (Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila 5.142)</p>
<p></p>
<p>satyarh satyarh punab satyam uddbrtya bhujam-ucyate</p>
<p>vedac chastrath pararh nasti na devab kesavat parab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Raising my arms in the air, I loudly declare that</p>
<p>there is no text greater than the Vedas, and no Deity</p>
<p>superior to KeSava (Krsna). Again and again I say</p>
<p>this is true, this is true, this is true. (Hari-varisa,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sesa-dharma-parva 2.15)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perfection of life in the material world means the culti-</p>
<p>vation of social structure, (dharma), economic development</p>
<p>(artha), material enjoyment (kama) and salvation (moksa).</p>
<p>History shows us that seldom ever does a civilisation pro-</p>
<p>gress beyond social structure, economic development and</p>
<p>matetial enjoyment. Salvation is the fourth goal of life and</p>
<p>is rarely sought by those absorbed in material consciousness.</p>
<p>Such hedonistic societies are easily satisfied by the fulfilment</p>
<p>of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Even more rare</p>
<p>than salvation however is the fifth goal of life, prema-bhakti,</p>
<p>ot bhakti-yoga, the yoga of love.</p>
