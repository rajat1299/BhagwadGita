<p>One cannot practice yoga by eating too much or too little,</p>
<p>nor sleeping too much or too little, O Arjuna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 17</p>
<p>युक्ताहारविहारस्य युक्तचेष्टस्य कर्म॑सु |</p>
<p>सुक्तस्वपाववोधस्य योगो भवति दुःखहा ॥ VON</p>
<p></p>
<p>yuktabara-vibarasya yukta-cestasya karmasu</p>
<p></p>
<p>yukta-svapnavabodhasya yogo bhavati dubkba-ba</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yoga destroys the suffering of one who is moderate in</p>
<p>eating and sleeping, who performs all activities in a regu-</p>
<p>lated manner and is well balanced in sleeping and waking.</p>

<p>Sti Krsna again informs Arjuna in verse 15 that the final</p>
<p>goal of yoga is to attain His Supreme Abode (Vaikuntha</p>
<p>ot Goloka Vrndavana). This is indeed the ultimate goal of</p>
<p>the yoga system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One cannot be a yogi if one eats too much or not</p>
<p>enough. Eating too much also means eating things like</p>
<p>non-vegetarian foodstuff to maintain the body. This is not</p>
<p>actually required. Nor can one be a yog? if one does not eat</p>
<p>enough. This also means that one should not abstain from</p>
<p>eating milk products by considering it as non-vegetarian.</p>
<p>Milk is the most complete food possible. Milk products</p>
<p>help to develop a strong bodily constitution and nourish</p>
<p>our brain cells and thus our thinking capacity. Yoga is</p>
<p>something that has been practiced in India for thousands</p>
<p>of years and from then until now, yogis have recommended</p>
<p>taking milk and milk products like yogurt and cheese etc.</p>
<p>Only in recent times have some people thought it bad to</p>
