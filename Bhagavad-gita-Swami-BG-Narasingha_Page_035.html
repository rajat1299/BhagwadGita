<p>अ CHAPTER 1 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>wherein underestimating the will of a people has led to the</p>
<p>oss of millions of innocent lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The classic commentators on Bhagavad-gita have all</p>
<p>pointed out the blunder of Duryodhana at Kutuksetra.</p>
<p>articularly it has been mentioned that Duryodhana failed</p>
<p>to recognise that when इल Krsna, the Supreme Person,</p>
<p>was there to advise Arjuna, that Arjuna would be a most</p>
<p>formidable opponent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>History has shown us that wars are fought out of greed,</p>
<p>hatred or religious prejudice. It is simply a convenience to</p>
<p>think that, ‘God is on our side.’ The idea that ‘God is on</p>
<p></p>
<p>our side’ is certainly a comforting thought and has accom-</p>
<p></p>
<p>panied men into almost every war that we know of since</p>
<p>the rise of Abrahamic religions. However, the problem has</p>
<p>always been that in all these conflicts both sides assumed</p>
<p>the banner of righteousness, declaring, ‘God wills it? This</p>
<p>is sometimes called the ‘theology of convenience’.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even today it makes good to stir up the troops or rally</p>
<p>the suicide bombers to their deaths by d eclaring that,</p>
<p></p>
<p>“</p>
<p></p>
<p>God favours our cause.” It is a fact that during these</p>
<p></p>
<p>dark periods of history, more people have died, and more</p>
<p>innocent people put to death in the name of God, than</p>
<p>by any other single unnatural cause. Many people con-</p>
<p></p>
<p>sider despotic political regimes as the ultimate empires</p>
<p></p>
<p>of cruelty, bat the truth is that religious fanaticism has</p>
<p>brought far more unnecessary death to the world than any</p>
<p>political system of government.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what makes the war at Kuruksetra any different</p>
<p>than modern wars fought for greed ot between religious</p>
<p>fanatics? Is it not simply jingoism to say that because Sti</p>
<p>Krsna, the Supreme Petson, was on the side of the Panda-</p>
