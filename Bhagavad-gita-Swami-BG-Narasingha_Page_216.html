<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>tesarh jfiant nitya~yukta cka-bbaktir visisyate</p>
<p>priyo bi jfianino’tyartham abath sa ca mama priyab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of these, one who desires self-realisation is superior. He is</p>
<p>always absorbed in thoughts of Me and engaged in bhak-</p>
<p>ti~yoga. I am very dear to him and he is very dear to Me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 18</p>
<p>उदाराः सव॑ Wa ज्ञानी त्वात्मेव मे मतम्‌ |</p>
<p>आस्थितः स हि युक्तात्मा मामेवानुत्तमां गतिम्‌. ॥ १८॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>udarab sarva evaite jiani tvatmaiva me matam</p>
<p>asthitah sa bi yuktatma mam evanuttamarh gatim</p>
<p></p>
<p>Certainly all of them are virtuous, yet I regard the self-real-</p>
<p>ised devotee to be as My own Self because his mind is fully</p>
<p>fixed upon Me as his ultimate goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna speaks here about His maya potency, also</p>
<p>known as maha-maya, to distinguish it from His internal</p>
<p>potency known as yoga-maya. Maha-maya is the potency</p>
<p>of material energy and the modes of nature that condi-</p>
<p>tion all living beings in matetial existence, binding them</p>
<p>to sarusara. These three modes of material nature will be</p>
<p>discussed at length in Chapter 14 of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says that to escape the modes of material nature</p>
<p>is very difficult for the conditioned living being, but one</p>
<p>who takes shelter of Krsna in bhakti-yoga can easily cross</p>
<p>beyond them. This is recommended as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>akamab sarva-kamo va moksa-~kama udara-d bib</p>
<p>tivrena bhakti-yogena Yajeta purusath param</p>
<p></p>
