<p>Myf CHAPTER 18 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 28</p>
<p>अयुक्तः प्राकृतः स्तब्धः Tel नेष्कृतिकोऽरसः |</p>
<p>विषादी दीर्घसूत्री च कतां तामस उच्यते ॥२८॥</p>
<p>ayuktab prakrtab stabdbab Satho naiskrtiko’lasab</p>
<p></p>
<p>visadi dirgha-sutri ca karta tamasa ucyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who perform work in an undisciplined manner,</p>
<p>those who are coarse, stubborn, unscrupulous, offensive,</p>
<p>lazy, bad-tempered and procrastinate are said to be in the</p>
<p>mode of ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Herein, actions in goodness, passion and ignorance are</p>
<p>described. When one looks at the world today, bearing</p>
<p>in mind the different modes of action and their charac-</p>
<p>teristics, then it is no wonder that the planet is in such a</p>
<p>state of conflict, inflation, depression, economic despair,</p>
<p>confusion and denial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When people are busy exercising their over-inflated</p>
<p>egos, acting unsctupulously and violently toward their</p>
<p>fellow human beings and animals, how ate we to expect</p>
<p>any improvement in the world? How can there be peace?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, it is the duty of every sane homan being to</p>
<p>cultivate knowledge and actions in the mode of goodness</p>
<p>that are without attachment or aversion and are free from</p>
<p>desire and egotism. Life is a science, and Sti Krsna says</p>
<p>that through our actions we reap the harvest of our good</p>
<p></p>
<p>ot bad karma.</p>
