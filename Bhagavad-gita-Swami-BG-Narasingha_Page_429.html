<p>Bye CHAPTER 17 व</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 21</p>
<p>यत्तु प्रत्युपकारार्थं फलमुदिङ्य वा पुनः ।</p>
<p>दीयते च परिख्िषटं तदानं राजसंस्मृतम्‌ ॥२९१॥</p>
<p>yat tu pratyupakarartharh phalam uddigya va punab</p>
<p>diyate ca pariklistarn tad dana rajasath smrtam</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, charity that is given reluctantly, with the expec-</p>
<p>tation of return and with a selfish desire for results, is in</p>
<p></p>
<p>the mode of passion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 22</p>
<p>अदेशकाले यदानमपात्रेभ्यश्च दीयते |</p>
<p>असत्कृतमवज्ञातं तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्‌ ॥२२॥</p>
<p>11110717</p>
<p></p>
<p>asatkrtam विया tat tamasam udabrtam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Charity that is given with disdain, at the wrong time and.</p>
<p>place, to an unworthy beneficiary, is said to be in the mode</p>
<p>of ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now the ideal of charity is being discussed — what types</p>
<p>of charity should be performed, to whom and for what pur-</p>
<p>pose. It is certainly the duty of every person to look out for</p>
<p>his fellow human being. As such, no one should go hungry</p>
<p>in this world, be without clothing, proper shelter, educa-</p>
<p>tion or sufficient medical care. That is the ideal for human</p>
<p>society. But our present reality is quite different — there</p>
<p>are shortages of food, inadequate clothing, shelter, educa-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tion and medical treatment in many places in the world,</p>
<p></p>
<p>causing millions of human beings to suffer unnecessarily.</p>
<p>This suffering, however, is not due to a lack of commodi-</p>
