<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Altogether, there are nine processes in bhakti-yoga to</p>
<p>fully engage oneself in devotion to Krsna. Of these, hearing</p>
<p>and chanting ate the first and foremost:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sravanam kirtanam visnobh smaranath pada-sevanam</p>
<p>arcanam vandanat dasyarh sakbyam atma-nivedanam</p>
<p>iti purhsarpita visnau bbaktis cen nava-laksana</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hearing and chanting the maba-mantra and the</p>
<p>activities of Visnu or Krsna, remembering Him,</p>
<p>serving His lotus feet, offering Him respectful wor-</p>
<p>ship, offering prayers to Him, becoming His servant,</p>
<p>considering Him as one’s dearest friend, and surren-</p>
<p>dering everything to Him. These nine processes are</p>
<p></p>
<p>accepted as bhakti-yoga. (Srimad Bhagavatam 7.5.23)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse 10 we find the word priti-pirvakam. Priti</p>
<p>means love, but this love should not be confused with the</p>
<p>love and affections of this material world which are shared</p>
<p>between conditioned living beings. Priti is the state of pure</p>
<p>affection wherein no expression of selfishness or mundane</p>
<p>lust can be found. Such love is the requirement for wor-</p>
<p>shipping Krsna and such love is the key to an eternal bond</p>
<p>with Him. Those who have attained such love for Krsna ||</p>
<p>bhakti-~yoga are continuously empowered by Him with the</p>
<p>inspiration of pure devotion (buddbi-yoga), by which they</p>
<p>may come to Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna dwells in the hearts of all living beings as the</p>
<p>Patamatma, the Super Consciousness, and directs the wan-</p>
<p>derings of everyone. When one desites to know Krsna, to</p>
<p></p>
<p>serve Krsna and to enter into an eternal relationship with</p>
<p></p>
<p>Him, then out of compassion for them, Krsna personally</p>
