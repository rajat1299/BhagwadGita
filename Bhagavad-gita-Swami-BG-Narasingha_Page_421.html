<p>Bye CHAPTER 17 व</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 10</p>
<p>यातयामं गतरसं पूति पयषितं च यत्‌ ।</p>
<p>उच्छिष्टमपि चामेध्यं भोजनं तामसप्रियम्‌ ॥१०॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>वक्वा pata-rasarh puti paryusitarh ca yat</p>
<p>ucchistam api camedbyarh bhojanarh tamasa-priyam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Food that is stale, tasteless, foul-smelling, rotten, left by</p>
<p>others and unfit for sacrifice is dear to those in the mode</p>
<p></p>
<p>of ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the French politician,</p>
<p>lawyer and connoisseut wrote in 1826, “Dis-moi ce que</p>
<p>tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es — Tell me what you eat</p>
<p>and I will tell you what you ate.” In other words, you are</p>
<p>what you eat. But in ancient times this was better under-</p>
<p>stood than in today’s world. Sti Krsna says that all food is</p>
<p>divided into three groups and is dear to one according to</p>
<p>the acquired mode of nature.</p>
<p>Food that increases life, gives energy, strength, health,</p>
<p>happiness and satisfaction is in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>This includes fruits, vegetables, grains, sugar, salt, spices</p>
<p>and milk products. These are basically known as vegetarian</p>
<p>foods and are dear to those in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Food that is too bitter, too sour, too sweet, too salty,</p>
<p>too spicy, too pungent and too dry, that creates excessive</p>
<p>heat in the stomach, causes pain, creates gas and disease is</p>
<p>to be known as food in the mode of passion. Such food</p>
<p>may be vegetatian, bat it is usually over-salted, and over-</p>
<p>spiced. Too much salt and spice creates mucus in the body</p>
<p></p>
<p>and leads to such diseases as high blood pressure, heart</p>
<p>failure, diabetes and cancer. Such food should be avoided.</p>
