<p>अट CHAPTER 4 ABE</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who understands My divine appearance and activities</p>
<p>never takes birth again after giving up this material body.</p>
<p>He comes to Me, O Arjuna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>To understand Sti Krsna’s appeatance and activities</p>
<p>is indeed to become situated beyond the cycle of birth</p>
<p>and death. In material life all living beings are in a per-</p>
<p>petual state of transmigration from one birth to the next.</p>
<p>Only when one attains pute spiritual consciousness does</p>
<p>sathsara, ot transmigration, cease. Krsna tells Arjuna that</p>
<p>both of them have passed through many births that Arjuna</p>
<p>has forgotten, but Krsna remembers them all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because the living beings change bodies at the time of</p>
<p></p>
<p>death, they also forget their previous lives. Krsna is the</p>
<p>Absolute Truth and thus He does not change His body ot</p>
<p>transmigrtate to another body at any time. Because He does</p>
<p>not undergo a change of body He does not forget. Krsna</p>
<p>is non-different from His body, whereas living beings in</p>
<p>material life are units of consciousness that are embod-</p>
<p>ied by material elements. The bodies of all living beings</p>
<p>in the material world are made of the basic elements of</p>
<p>earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intelligence and false</p>
<p>ego. Krsna is sac-cid-ananda — eternity, knowledge and</p>
<p>bliss. Krsna’s body is also sac-cid-ananda, thus Krsna and</p>
<p>Kysna’s body are non-different. They are transcendental,</p>
<p>spiritual substances.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna not only remembers all His previous births,</p>
<p>but He remembers all of Atjuna’s previous births also.</p>
<p>This is the characteristic of the Absolute Truth who is</p>
<p></p>
<p>fully omniscient.</p>
