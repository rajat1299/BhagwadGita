<p>by birth. One may be born in the family of workmen but</p>
<p>show exttaordinary intellectual prowess and so forth. As</p>
<p>such, one is to be heartily welcomed into the intellectual</p>
<p>community. Similarly, one may be born to a wealthy mer-</p>
<p>cantile family but show great promise as a military leader.</p>
<p>Thus one is encouraged to follow that line of work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When one petforms the work prescribed to him accord-</p>
<p>ing to his qualities, and devotes that work to please the</p>
<p>Supreme Person Krsna, then such a person achieves the</p>
<p>highest perfection. This is confirmed as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>atab pumbbir dvija-Srestha varnasrama-vibhaga sab</p>
<p>svanusthitasya dharmasya satnsiddbir hari-tosanam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt is concluded that the highest petfection one can</p>
<p>achieve by discharging one’s occupational duties</p>
<p>according to the varna and asrama orders of life is</p>
<p></p>
<p>to please Krsna. (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.2.13)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in modetn times some persons have</p>
<p>given a wrong interpretation to the eligibility of the varnas</p>
<p>by placing all emphasis on one’s birth in a particular</p>
<p>family. This has been invented to create a sense of social</p>
<p>superiority wherein elite members of Vedic society who</p>
<p>ate born as brabmanas and ksatriyas are given special priv-</p>
<p>ileges, while others who are born as vaisyas and Sadras are</p>
<p>not. This system has created havoc in India for more than</p>
<p>one thousand years and is known as the caste system. The</p>
<p>caste system however is a total misrepresentation of the</p>
<p>system of varias created by Krsna.</p>
