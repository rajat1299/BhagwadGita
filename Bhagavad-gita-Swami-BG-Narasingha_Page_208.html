<p>for existence. Space itself, both internal and external, is the</p>
<p>element khari. This then, if taken notice of by physicists,</p>
<p>may very well fit nicely into the “Missing Mass Problem’.</p>
<p>Kham, being a material element, could theoretically be</p>
<p>assigned a numerical code — then they might find what</p>
<p>they are looking for.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Vedic way of thinking, a physical element is</p>
<p>secondaty to its qualities — when the qualities of a par-</p>
<p>ticular thing are understood, it is as good as ot better than</p>
<p>having the gross object at hand. In that sense, modern</p>
<p>science has already discovered Dark Matter, because they</p>
<p>have understood something of its qualities — they just hav-</p>
<p>en't realised it yet. In the Srimad Bhagavatam we find the</p>
<p></p>
<p>following verse:</p>
<p></p>
<p>bhiatanam chidra-datrtvam babir antaram eva ca</p>
<p>pranendriyatma-dbisnyatvarh nabbaso vrtti-laksanam</p>
<p></p>
<p>The activities and characteristics of nabbas can be</p>
<p>observed as accommodation for external and inter-</p>
<p>nal existences of all living beings, namely the field</p>
<p>of activities of the vital air, the senses and the mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Srimad Bhagavatam 3.26.34)</p>
<p></p>
<p>This verse is the potential basis for great scientific</p>
<p>reseatch work. It explains how subtle forms are generated</p>
<p>from nabbas, what their characteristics and actions are,</p>
<p>and how the tangible elements, namely ait, fire, water and</p>
<p>earth, are manifested from the subtle form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavatam does not simply list the basic material ele-</p>
<p>ments, but explains quite scientifically how those elements</p>
<p>evolve from the most subtle plane of existence up to the</p>
