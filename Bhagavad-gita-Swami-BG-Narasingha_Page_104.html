<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>as Hindus, were pagans — pagan meaning the worshippers</p>
<p>of many gods and not one Supreme God. Thus western</p>
<p>observers conclude that monotheism, the worship or rever-</p>
<p>ence of one Supreme God, originated with the Abrahamic</p>
<p>religions of the west. This however is not a fact.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Vedic pantheon does indeed include many lesser</p>
<p>demigods, bat the Vedic texts are quite clear that there</p>
<p>is only one Supreme Being or Saper Consciousness that</p>
<p>is above all. That is always referred to as Brahman, Par-</p>
<p>amatma, Bhagavan, Visnu or Krsna. For example, the Rg</p>
<p></p>
<p>Veda (1. 22. 20) states as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>tad visnob paramarh padath sada pasyanti surayab</p>
<p>diviva caksur atatam</p>
<p></p>
<p>The divine feet of Visnu are above all, like the san</p>
<p>above out heads. His holy feet are like the vigilant</p>
<p></p>
<p>eye of a grand guardian over out heads like the sun.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavatam says:</p>
<p>ete camsa kalab pumsab krsnas tu bhagavan svayam</p>
<p></p>
<p>The various avataras are either plenary expansions</p>
<p>or patts of plenary expansions. But Sti Krsna is</p>
<p>the original source of all these avataras. (Srimad</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavatam 1.3.28)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Historically speaking, it is erroneous to assume that</p>
<p>monotheism was developed by Abrahamic civilisations</p>
<p>independent of any outside influence. In fact, the Abra-</p>
<p>hamic religions borrowed the idea of monotheism from the</p>
<p></p>
<p>Persians after King Cyrus subjugated Babylon and Judea</p>
