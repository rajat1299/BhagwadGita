<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvertti</p>
<p>This second chapter is where the Bhagavad-gita truly</p>
<p>begins. Bhagavad-gita literally means the ‘Song of Bhaga-</p>
<p>van’ and Bhagavan means the Absolute Truth. Here for</p>
<p>the first time in Bhagavad-gita, St Krsna is addressed as</p>
<p>Bhagavan. According to Vedic scholars such as Paraésara</p>
<p>Muni, Bhagavan means one who possesses all wealth,</p>
<p></p>
<p>strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>aisvaryasya samagrasya viryasya yaSasab Sriyab</p>
<p>jfana vairagyayos caiva sannarmh bhaga itirana</p>
<p></p>
<p>He that possesses the attributes of sovereignty,</p>
<p>potency, fame, wealth, knowledge and renunciation</p>
<p></p>
<p>in full, is known as Bhagavan. (Visnu Purana 6.5.74)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, Jiva Gosvami, the 16th Century Vaisnava</p>
<p>phi osopher, says that Bhagavan is bhajaniya guna ca</p>
<p>ananta ca nityab — He that possesses all adorable qualities</p>
<p>and whose all-attractive nature is such that He attracts our</p>
<p>feelings of affection and adoration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>n contemporaty society there is much debate as to</p>
<p>whether God exists or not. First it is necessary to define</p>
<p>what we mean by ‘God’ before His existence can be deter-</p>
<p>mined or dismissed. Accordingly, seers of the trath in</p>
<p>ancient India have concluded that if there is a God, then</p>
<p>God must necessarily be the owner and proprietor of</p>
<p></p>
<p>everything; He must be all-powerful, the most famous, the</p>
<p>most beautifal, the possessor of all knowledge and at the</p>
<p>same time, detached ot renounced. After careful analysis,</p>
<p>those seers of trath concluded that only Sti Krsna could</p>
<p>be and is the ultimate fountainhead of Reality, the Abso-</p>
