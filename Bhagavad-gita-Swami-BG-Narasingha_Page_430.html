<p>ties as much as it is due to mismanagement and hoarding.</p>
<p>There ate sufficient facilities to maintain everyone on this</p>
<p>Earth in a proper state of health and well-being, but the</p>
<p>facilities are simply mismanaged. And more to blame than</p>
<p>the mismanagement between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’</p>
<p>of this world, is hoarding. There is enough wealth in the</p>
<p>world to easily solve the problems facing humanity, par-</p>
<p>ticularly that of hunger — but that wealth is being hoarded</p>
<p>by a very small minority of people. They have amassed</p>
<p></p>
<p>so much that no individual could spend or use that much</p>
<p>wealth within one or even a dozen lifetimes. Corporate</p>
<p>giants receive millions of dollars in annual bonuses while</p>
<p>millions of children die each year due to malnutrition. Is</p>
<p>this not shameful?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Charity, like other things discussed in this chapter, is</p>
<p>also in the different modes of nature according to how it is</p>
<p>given and whom it is given to. There 13 charity in goodness,</p>
<p>passion and ignorance as stated by Sti Krsna above, but</p>
<p>ultimately the highest charity is to give that which helps</p>
<p>the haman being bring an end to all material miseries and</p>
<p>even to death itself. Such charity is the distribution of the</p>
<p>spititual wealth found in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The root cause of all suffering in the world is a lack of</p>
<p>understanding of who we are, where we have come from,</p>
<p>what the purpose of life is and where we will go at the</p>
<p>time of death. One who understands these things from the</p>
<p>perspective of Bhagavad-gita becomes fall in knowledge,</p>
<p>free from the illusion of the body as the self and ultimately</p>
<p>defeats death. This is the highest gift and greatest charity</p>
<p></p>
<p>that one can give a fellow human being.</p>
