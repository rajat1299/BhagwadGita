<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>The concept of liberation in the impersonal Brahman</p>
<p>is often sought by those who are frustrated with material</p>
<p>existence, but who have no knowled. ge of Krsna. Certainly a</p>
<p>sense of detachment and renunciation from material activ-</p>
<p>ities is laudable, but Krsna says that path is more trouble</p>
<p>than it is worth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If one endeavours for the perfection of life by con-</p>
<p>trolling the senses, being equipoised in all circumstances,</p>
<p>cultivates the impetsonal Brahman conception, and at the</p>
<p>same time is dedicated to helping all living beings, then</p>
<p>such a person may eventually reach Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The impetsonal path, Krsna says, is very troublesome and</p>
<p>difficult to attain. Therefore, it is expected that ascending</p>
<p></p>
<p>such a path can extend over many lifetimes and there is also</p>
<p>the chance of total failure and loss.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Brahmavadis must cultivate sense-control etc. as</p>
<p>mentioned above with the study of Vedanta. After many</p>
<p>lifetimes, by cultivating sach knowledge, when the Brah-</p>
<p>mavadi understands that Krsna is everything (vasudevah</p>
<p>sarvam iti), he at last reaches Him. The Sanyavadi and</p>
<p>the Mayavadi never reach Krsna until they adopt the path</p>
<p>of bhakti-yoga. However, a Vaisnava may come to Krsna</p>
<p></p>
<p>consciousness in one lifetime.</p>
