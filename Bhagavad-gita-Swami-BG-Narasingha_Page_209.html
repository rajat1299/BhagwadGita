<p>divisions of the universe — this is quite elaborate and sci-</p>
<p>entific indeed. Yet for science to take full advantage of this</p>
<p>understanding of matter and to discover how the universe</p>
<p>came into being, they will have to do mote than just add</p>
<p>kbarh to their table of elements — they will have to add</p>
<p>abankara (false ego), mana (the mind) and buddbi Cintel-</p>
<p>ligence). For indeed, Bhagavad-gita lists these as material</p>
<p>elements. Furthermore, these elements, abankara, mana</p>
<p>and buddhi are categorised as even more subtle than kbam,</p>
<p>because they are closer in character to consciousness (ama).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the gross and subtle material elements being</p>
<p>added to the scientific table, Bhagavad-gita says that a</p>
<p>complete understanding of existence and reality is not</p>
<p>possible without adding two transcendental, anti-material</p>
<p>concepts — namely dima and Paramatma (consciousness</p>
<p>and Super Consciousness). This, it seems, science strug-</p>
<p>gles with even more than Dark Matter. We have dubbed</p>
<p>these ‘Light Matter’.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mind and inte. igence should not be confused with the</p>
<p>self or atma. Mind and intelligence have not arisen out of</p>
<p>matter as some philosophers or scientists have suggested.</p>
<p>Last in the list is abankara or false ego. All these are mate-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tial elements which manifest from the apara-prakrti or the</p>
<p>inferior energy of Krsna. These gross and subtle elements</p>
<p>make up the material body and cover the self within.</p>
<p>Those conditioned by material elements consider the</p>
<p>body as the self. But Krsna says that there is another energy</p>
<p></p>
<p>of His — a superior energy, which is a conscious potency</p>
<p></p>
<p>and consists of all living eings.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita clearly explains both the gross and subtle</p>
<p></p>
<p>material elements as well as consciousness and Super Con-</p>
