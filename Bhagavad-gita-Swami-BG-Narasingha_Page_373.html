<p>Bye CHAPTER 14 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the above five verses the characteristics of the three</p>
<p>modes of nature are further described as well as their influ-</p>
<p>ence over the embodied living being at the time of death.</p>
<p>When one dies in the mode of goodness, illuminated by</p>
<p>knowledge, he reaches the higher planets where those of</p>
<p>great intellect reside. When one dies in the mode of pas-</p>
<p>sion, characterised by greed, selfish activities, ambition,</p>
<p>restlessness and hankering, he is reborn amongst those</p>
<p>who are attached to worldly activities. And when the most</p>
<p>unfortunate amongst men die in the mode of ignorance,</p>
<p>chatacterised by darkness, laziness, confusion and delusion,</p>
<p>they take birth again in the womb of uncivilised people or</p>
<p>even worse, descend into the animal kingdom to become</p>
<p>dogs, cats and beasts of burden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 16</p>
<p>कर्मणः सुकृतस्याहुः सात्त्विकं निर्मलं फलम्‌ |</p>
<p>TET फं दुःखमज्ञानं तमसः फलम्‌ ॥ १६॥</p>
<p>karmanab sukrtasyabub sattvikarh nirmalarh phalam</p>
<p>rajasas tu phalarn dubkham ajfianarh tamasab phalam</p>
<p></p>
<p>It has been said that the result of good deeds is purity, the</p>
<p>results of passionate activities is misery, and the result of</p>
<p>actions in ignorance is bewilderment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 17</p>
<p>सत्त्वात्सञ्ञायते ज्ञानं रजसो रोभ एव च |</p>
<p>प्रमादमोहौ तमसो भवतोऽज्ञानमेव च ॥ १७॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sattvat sanjayate (विन rajaso lobha eva ca</p>
<p></p>
<p>pramada-mohau tamaso bhavato’jianam eva ca</p>
