<p>Bye CHAPTER 16 स</p>
<p></p>
<p>lust, anger and greed, one must apply oneself diligently to</p>
<p>controlling the senses and perform the prescribed activities</p>
<p>in bhakti-yoga known as sadhana. The practice of sadhana</p>
<p>is learned from the gard, a tattva-dars who has seen the</p>
<p>truth, and the gura instructs the student according to their</p>
<p>ability and present stage of advancement. To this end,</p>
<p>the gura will advise all students in bhakti-yoga to chant</p>
<p>the maba-mantra and fix the mind upon Sti Krsna. This</p>
<p>process is purifying and beneficial to everyone, regardless</p>
<p>of one’s being a novice or being very advanced. Everyone</p>
<p>should engage in chanting the maba-mantra to defeat the</p>
<p>enemies of lust, anget and greed, and to dispel the igno-</p>
<p></p>
<p>rance and darkness of the age of Kali-yaga.</p>

<p>The chanting of the maba-mantra can relieve us</p>
<p>from all undesirable habits, all unwanted charac-</p>
<p>teristics and all miseries. Chant the maba-mantra!</p>
<p>Nothing else is necessary. Chant the maha-mantra</p>
<p>and begin your real life in this dark age of Kali-</p>
<p>yuga with the most broad and wide theistic con-</p>
<p>ception. Let us all bow down to Sti Krsna. (Srimad</p>
