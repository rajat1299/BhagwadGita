<p>Bye CHAPTER 17 व</p>
<p></p>
<p>and associating with the virtuous and pious, one develops</p>
<p>sukrti, accumulated merit. This sukrti then leads one to the</p>
<p>association of sadbus (self-realised yogis) and under their</p>
<p>guidance nirguna-Sraddha develops and progresses through</p>
<p>various stages — ultimately reaching the highest stage of</p>
<p>self-realisation, prema-bbakti.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nirguna-Sraddba awakens in the heart of the bhakti-yogi</p>
<p>and enables one to see, hear and feel the subjective world,</p>
<p>the Absolute Truth. Nixguna-sraddha is that which reveals</p>
<p>Kysna just as a flash of lightning reveals the shape of a</p>
<p></p>
<p>monsoon tain cloud in the dead of night. In the darkness</p>
<p></p>
<p>of night, the cloud cannot be seen, but when lightning</p>
<p>appears, the form of the cloud becomes visible. Similarly,</p>
<p>when nireuna-Ssraddba appears in the heart of the yogi, one</p>
<p>can perceive the ultimate form of beauty that is Sti Krsna.</p>
<p>Guided by nirguna-sraddba, the student of bhakti-yoga</p>
<p>will feel that one is meant for Krsna — that he is not an</p>
<p>independent being. One must feel completely dependent on</p>
<p>Kysna. Such is the process of understanding the Supreme</p>
<p>Petson, who is beyond the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Krsna says that one who is driven by lust, ambition,</p>
<p>power, pride and egotism often undergoes severe austerities</p>
<p>that are not prescribed in the Vedas or in the process of</p>
<p>bhakti-yoga — such austerities parch the senses of the body.</p>
<p>These may include austerities such as prolonged periods</p>
<p>of fasting, self-flagellation, self-crucifixion, wearing cilice</p>
<p>chains, piercing the body, walking on hot coals and so on.</p>
<p>Because these austerities are performed in the mode of</p>
<p>ignotance they neglect the Paramatma within — thus lead-</p>
<p>ing to no good result. Krsna says the performers of such</p>
<p></p>
<p>austerities are to be known as asuras.</p>
