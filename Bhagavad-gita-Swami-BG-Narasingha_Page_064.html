<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Carvaka up to the present day, there are those who think</p>
<p>that life arises out of matter. The Big Bang Theory and</p>
<p>other contemporaty scientific ideas also support this</p>
<p>opinion. However, the problem with such thinking is that</p>
<p>there is no conctete evidence whatsoever to explain or</p>
<p>demonstrate how lifeless matter ever developed the symp-</p>
<p>toms of life. The Theory of Evolution, as the Darwinians</p>
<p>understand it, is substantially defeated in the fossil record,</p>
<p>since no ‘transitional species,’ that are supposed to reveal</p>
<p></p>
<p>the gradual evolution of living organisms from primitive</p>
<p></p>
<p>i</p>
<p></p>
<p>pecies to advanced life forms, have ever been discovered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no suitable model to explain where</p>
<p>matter originated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The numerous theories, new and ancient, that expound</p>
<p>that life arose from matter are fundamentally flawed in</p>
<p>many ways. On the other hand, from observing micro-</p>
<p>scopic living creatures to giant creatures like the elephant</p>
<p>and whale, it is self-evident that life comes from life. Thus,</p>
<p>the Vedic perspective on life is that all life comes from an</p>
<p></p>
<p>intelligent life source, Sti Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Scientific interest in finding the cause of the universe,</p>
<p>and indeed to all life, is certainly laudable. Yet when all</p>
<p>reasonable and honest research leads us to the conclusion</p>
<p>that life/consciousness is not a byproduct of matter and</p>
<p>the blueprint of intelligent design can be observed every-</p>
<p>where and in all things, then it should also be intelligently</p>
<p></p>
<p>concluded that Super Consciousness is the cause of matter,</p>
<p>the universe and all living things.</p>
