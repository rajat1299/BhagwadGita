<p>O son of Kunti, if you are killed you will attain the higher</p>

<p>Atjuna’s social position was that of a ksatriya, a</p>
<p>member of the wartior class. As such, it was Arjuna’s</p>
<p>solemn duty to uphold righteousness and to protect the</p>
<p>kingdom from aggressors. By law and social decree, Arjuna</p>
<p>and his brothers were the rightful heirs to the throne, yet</p>
<p>the throne had been usurped by his uncle Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>Arjuna, his wife Draupadi, his mother Kunti and his</p>
<p>brothers Yudhisthira, Bhima, Sahadeva and Nakula had</p>
<p>all been forcibly exiled from the kingdom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna knows the temperament of Arjuna very well</p>
<p>and therefore He is appealing to Arjuna’s ksatriya spirit</p>
<p>to stand and fight. Krsna reminds Arjuna that only shame</p>
<p>awaits him if he neglects his duty. His enemies will speak</p>
