<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>The faults of material life are many. Herein, Sti Krsna</p>
<p>has mentioned certain faults that a serious student of the</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita should be preeminently aware of. Ignorance,</p>
<p>foolishness, selfish motivation, a false sense of proprietor-</p>
<p>ship, as well as attraction and aversion to the sense-objects</p>
<p>ate mentioned by Krsna. But more dangerous than any</p>
<p>other fault is envy. Envy, it seems, is purely evil as Krsna</p>
<p>says that those who do not follow the teachings of the</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita out of enviousness are bereft of all knowl-</p>
<p></p>
<p>edge and inte igence.</p>
<p>Another danger is the tendency of neglecting one’s own</p>
<p></p>
<p>duty and trying to perform the duty of another. In other</p>
<p>words, Krsna tells Arjuna to tend to his own business.</p>
<p>Arjana isa ksatriya and his duty, as already discussed, is to</p>
<p>protect and defend the kingdom. Arjana however, 15 show-</p>
<p>ing leanings towards renunciation — becoming a monk, a</p>
<p>sannyast. Arjuna wants to abandon his duty and perform</p>
<p>that of another, but Krsna warns him that this is not a</p>
<p>good idea. In fact, Krsna says it is even dangerous. Krsna</p>
<p>explains that it is better to perform one’s own duty imper-</p>
<p>fectly than perform another's duty perfectly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In particular, Krsna is encouraging Arjuna to follow the</p>
<p>codes of conduct set down for ksatriyas — of which aban-</p>
<p></p>
<p>doning the battlefield for a warrior is not an option.</p>
