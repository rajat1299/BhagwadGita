<p>अ CHAPTER 1 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeing all his relatives before him on the battlefield,</p>
<p>Arjuna, the son of Kunti, became overcome with pity and</p>
<p></p>
<p>was grief-stricken.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 28</p>
<p>अजुन उवाच |</p>
<p>दृं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम्‌ |</p>
<p>सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति ॥२८॥</p>
<p>arjuna uvaca —</p>
<p>drstvematit svajanath krsna yuyu tsurt samupasthitam</p>
<p>sidanti mama gatrani mukbatt ca parisusyati</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arjuna said: O Krsna, seeing all my relatives assembled</p>
<p>here and preparing for battle, the strength drains from my</p>
<p></p>
<p>limbs and my mouth becomes parched.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna is known as Partha-sarathi, the chariot-driver</p>
<p>of Arjuna. Because Krsna was Arjuna’s friend and compan-</p>
<p>ion, he requested Krsna to draw his chariot between the</p>
<p>two armies so that he could see with whom he was to do</p>
<p>battle. But upon seeing the enemy before him, Arjana was</p>
<p>shocked and fell into a state of bewilderment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now the stage at Karuksetra was set, so that Sti Krsna</p>
<p>could speak Bhagavad-gita — Arjuna became overwhelmed</p>
<p>with grief and gave up his duty. As a warrior Arjuna was</p>
<p></p>
<p>duty-bound to fight, bat seeing the ordeal that lay ahead</p>
<p></p>
<p>he could not proceed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The world is certainly full of faults, dangers, unforta-</p>
<p>nate events, cruel and hateful designs to exploit others and</p>
<p>a host of other qualities that one would certainly describe</p>
<p>as evil. To quote Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman and</p>
<p></p>
<p>ad 15 &amp;s</p>
