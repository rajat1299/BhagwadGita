<p>मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दुःखाख्यमशाश्चतम्‌, |</p>
<p>नामरुबन्ति महात्मानः संसिद्धं परमां गताः ॥ ९५॥</p>

<p>mam upetya punar janma dubkbalayam asasvatam</p>
<p>napnuvanti mabatmanab sarhsiddbirh paramarh gatab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those great personalities who have attained Me never</p>
<p>take birth again in this temporary world of misery, for</p>
<p>they have reached the highest destination.</p>

<p>Modern systems of yoga focus more ot less on achiev-</p>
<p>ing a healthy condition for the body, but this is actually</p>
<p>not the aim of yoga. The process of yoga is intended for</p>
<p>one goa and one goal alone — to transcend the world</p>
<p>of birth and death. There is, of course, more than one</p>
<p>system of yoga, but all schools of yoga aim at a singular</p>
<p>goal — liberation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As already explained in previous commentaries, the</p>
<p>mantra orit elevates one to the stage of liberation. However,</p>
<p>it should be noted here that the divisions of yoga, such as</p>
<p>sense-control and celibacy, must also be in place before</p>
<p>the chanting of mantras can be effective. Mantras purify</p>
<p></p>
<p>the mind and heart of material contamination which arises</p>
<p>from sense enjoyment. If one endeavours for purification,</p>
<p>bat at the same time does not control the senses, then it 13</p>
<p>tantamount to starting a fire while simultaneously pouring</p>
<p>water on it. Sense-control is therefore essential for those</p>
<p></p>
<p>attempting to practice all forms of yoga.</p>
