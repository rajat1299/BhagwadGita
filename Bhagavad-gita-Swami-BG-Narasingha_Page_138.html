<p>Out of millions of wandering living beings, one who</p>
<p>is most fortunate gets an opportunity to associate</p>
<p>with a liberated person (gure) by the grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>By the mercy of Krsna and the garda, such a person</p>
<p>receives the seed of the creeper of bhakti. (Caitan-</p>
<p>ya-caritamrta, Madbya-lila 19.151)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The world is old — much older than many of us real-</p>
<p>ise and many things have changed over the ages. Yet the</p>
<p>basic principles of spiritual advancement and putting an</p>
<p>end to the problems of birth, death, old age and disease</p>
<p>remain the same. The advancement of modern civilisation</p>
<p>has actually done very little to solve the real problems of</p>
<p>life. We are given so-called higher education and better</p>
<p>standards of living, yet the basic problems remain — birth,</p>
<p>death, old age and disease. Now the real solution is at hand</p>
<p>and Sti Krsna wants Arjuna to accept it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To facilitate social harmony, efficiency and advance-</p>
<p>ment in spititual life, Krsna has created the four social</p>
<p>ordets in society called varuas. According to one’s sukrti,</p>
<p>or spititual merits derived from previous lifetimes, one</p>
<p>comes to the human form of life with certain innate qual-</p>
<p>ities. This is a natural system of order in the universe and</p>
<p>it is petceivable in all civilised societies. These human</p>
<p>tendencies are grouped into four basic classifications: the</p>
<p>intellectual, martial, mercantile and labourer classes. The</p>
<p>Vedic terms for these are brabmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stidras. According to Sti Krsna these varnas are determined</p>
<p></p>
<p>by one’s qualities and actions (guna-karma) and not simply</p>
