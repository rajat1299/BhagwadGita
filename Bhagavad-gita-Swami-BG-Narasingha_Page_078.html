<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>instructions of Sri Kysna with steady determination. This</p>
<p>state is only possible due to the great boon of having</p>
<p>attained a haman form of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, if one neglects the opportunity of self-real-</p>
<p>isation in human life then one certainly runs the risk of</p>
<p>sinking down into animal life or worse. It is sometimes</p>
<p>atgued that animals like cats and dogs have a better, more</p>
<p>comfortable life than many humans, and that is certainly</p>
<p>true for many cats and dogs in western countries. But there</p>
<p>is nO guarantee that in losing the haman form of life one</p>
<p>will become a dog ot cat and be taken care of by a tich</p>
<p></p>
<p>American family. One may become an animal that is eaten</p>
<p>alive by wild beasts or torn apart by predators in the sea.</p>
<p>Certainly it goes without saying that such a life and death</p>
<p>is full of suffering.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, to avoid the unnecessary suffering found in</p>
<p>animal life, a person who has achieved the human platform</p>
<p>should, with great determination and diligence, pursae the</p>
<p></p>
<p>path of self-realisation as outlined in Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p>VERSE 45</p>
<p>त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा Presa भवार्जुन |</p>
<p>feral नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान्‌ ॥४५॥</p>
<p>traigunya-visaya veda nistraiguiryo bhavarjuna</p>
<p>nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho niryoga-ksema atmavan</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Vedas deal with subjects in the three modes of mate-</p>
<p>rial nature. O Arjuna, become free from duality, situated.</p>
<p>in a state of pure spiritual consciousness, free from the</p>
<p>pursuits for gain and preservation and thus you will tran-</p>
<p>scend these three modes.</p>
