<p>the Vedic literature one will not find a process for this</p>
<p>age that is more sublime. (Kali-santarana Upanisad 2)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transcendental potency of the maba-mantra is fur-</p>
<p>ther described as follows in Padma Purana:</p>
<p></p>
<p>nama cintamanib krsna$ caitanya-rasa-vigrabab</p>
<p>purnab suddbo nitya-mukto ‘bhinnatvan nama-naminob</p>
<p></p>
<p>The name of Sti Krsna is a transcendental touch-</p>
<p>stone, full of all transcendental mellows. Complete,</p>
<p>pure, and eternally liberating, the name of Krsna is</p>
<p>non-different than Krsna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The study of the Bhagavad-gita and the practice of</p>
<p>sankirtana have now spread all over the world. It is no</p>
<p>longer something that is only available in India. There</p>

<p>the identification of the self as the body, as being a byprod-</p>
<p>uct of the body or that one is the doer of activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We walk, we talk, we digest food, we construct build-</p>
<p>ings and even empires, but all these activities are made</p>
<p>possible for us by a combination of material nature and</p>
<p>the Patamatma, the Super Consciousness that petvades</p>
<p>the entire universe. How all this transpires is inconceiva-</p>
<p>ble to those under the bodily conception of life. Thus the</p>
<p>idea that, “I am this body” arising from the false ego must</p>
<p>be abandoned. Who are we? Where do we come from?</p>
<p>Why ate we hete? Is there life after death? The answers to</p>
