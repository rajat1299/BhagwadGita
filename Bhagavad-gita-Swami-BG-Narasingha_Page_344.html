<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>You should know that I am the knower of all fields, O</p>
<p>descendant of Bharata. I consider the knowledge of the</p>
<p>field and its knower to be real knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrttt</p>
<p></p>
<p>The basis of knowledge, namely the ability to differen-</p>
<p>tiate between matter, consciousness and Super Conscious-</p>
<p>ness will further be explained in this chapter. In the last</p>
<p>few centuries western scientific understanding suggests that</p>
<p>consciousness atises out of an inexplicable combination of</p>
<p>material elements. In other words, they conclude that the</p>
<p>body is the self. Bhagavad -gita however, considers such an</p>
<p>understanding to be ignorance. Without understanding the</p>
<p>difference between material nature (prakrti) and the self</p>
<p>(ksetrajfia) who is the conscious knower of the body, there</p>
<p>is no basis of rea knowledge. Both are distinct from one</p>
<p>another and one who understands this is truly learned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The material body composed of the three subtle ele-</p>
<p>ments (mind, inte igence and false ego) and the five gross</p>
<p>elements (earth, water, fire, air and space) is known as</p>
<p>the field. The indwelling consciousness is known as the</p>
<p></p>
<p>knower of the field, and the Super Consciousness situated</p>
<p>within all bodies and within the individual consciousness</p>
<p>is the knowetr of all fields of activity. This is the subject of</p>
<p>this chapter, upon knowing which one becomes liberated</p>
<p></p>
<p>from material bond. age.</p>
