<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is sometimes thought that God, somehow or other,</p>
<p>dies for the sins of the world. This is not a very intelligent</p>
<p>idea, nor is it consistent with the spiritual science found in</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita. Kysna says that He does not cause anyone</p>
<p>to perform pious or impious activities nor does he accept</p>
<p>the reaction of anyone’s actions. The idea that God dies</p>
<p>for our sins is rejected. God is eternal; therefore He cannot</p>
<p>and does not die. The living beings ate also eternal, but</p>
<p>because they ate under the bodily concept of life, when</p>
<p>the body dies they also experience death — although they</p>
<p>actually do not die. Both the Absolute Truth and His parts</p>
<p>and patcels are eternal, beyond death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse 18 the relative vision of equality is expressed</p>
<p>for one who is situated in transcendental knowledge. The</p>
<p>wise man (pandita) sees all living beings equally, as units</p>
<p>of eternal consciousness. The distinction between vari-</p>
<p>ous bodies is only an apparent difference between living</p>
<p>beings. According to the Brhad-Visnu Purana, there are</p>
<p>8,400,000 different species of material bodies:</p>

<p>jalaja nava-laksani sthavara laksa-virnsatih</p>
<p>krmayo rudra-sankhyakab paksinarh daSa-laksakam</p>
<p>tritnSal-laksani pasavas-catur-laksani manusab</p>
<p></p>
<p>There ate 900,000 aquatic species and 2,000,000</p>
<p>non-moving species such as trees and plants. There</p>
<p>are 1,100,000 species of insects and reptiles and</p>
<p>1,000,000 species of birds. There are 3,000,000</p>
<p>vatieties of quadrupeds and 400,000 species of</p>
<p></p>
<p>homan beings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The unit of individual consciousness, the ama, transmi-</p>
<p>grates through these various species from one to the other</p>
