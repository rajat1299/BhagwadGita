<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>In verse sixty-six, we find the climax of Bhagavad-gita,</p>
<p>wherein the ultimate dharma of surrendering oneself fully</p>
<p>to Krsna is stated. Sti Krsna tells Arjuna that giving up</p>
<p>everything to follow His instructions need not be a cause</p>
<p>of fear because Krsna will protect him. By such self-sur-</p>
<p>render Arjuna will come to Krsna in His Supreme Abode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Supreme Abode lies beyond the material universe</p>
<p>and is known by those who are learned as Vaikuntha.</p>
<p>Those who wotship the Visnu avataras, or forms of</p>
<p>Narayana, will attain to the Vaikuntha realm. But superior</p>
<p>to Vaikantha are the realms of Krsna’s avataras such as Sti</p>
<p>Ramacandra in Ayodhya and Vasudeva Krsna in Dvaraka.</p>
<p>Those who worship Sti Ramacandta and Krsna’s expan-</p>
<p>sion as Vasudeva, will attain to Ayodhya, Dvaraka and</p>
<p>Mathura respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Superior to Dvaraka is Mathura. Superior to Mathura</p>
<p>is Vrndavana. Govardhana is supetiot to Vrndavana and</p>
<p>Radha-kunda is superior to Govardhana. Only those who</p>
<p>worship Krsna’s human-like form known as Syamasundara</p>
<p>(Govinda) will attain to the topmost realm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>vaikunthaj janito vara madbu-purt tatrapi rasotsavad</p>
<p>vrndaranyam udara-pani-ramanat tatrapi govardhanab</p>
<p>radba-kundam thapi gokula-pateh premamy tap lavanat</p>
<p>kuryad asya virajato giri-tate sevarh viveki na kab</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because Sti Krsna appeared there, Mathura is consid-</p>
<p>ered to be spititually superior to Vaikuntha. Greater</p>
<p>than Mathura is the forest of Vrndavana because</p>
<p>this was where the rasa-lila pastimes of Krsna took</p>
<p>place. Govardhana Hill is considered to be superior</p>
