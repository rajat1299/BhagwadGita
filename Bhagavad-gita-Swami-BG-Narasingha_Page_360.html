<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>A seer of the truth is never degraded by the influences</p>
<p>of material natare. He gradually rises to perfection and</p>
<p>attains the Supreme Abode of Krsna. Those who are con-</p>
<p>ditioned by material nature and who have no knowledge</p>
<p>of Super Consciousness wrongly conceive that they are the</p>
<p>doer of activities, or that they are the overlords of material</p>
<p>natute. This however is a foolish idea since they themselves</p>
<p>are helplessly suffering at the hands of death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For those that have the eyes to see, all forms of life</p>
<p>indicate the presence of a conscious living being. That</p>
<p>is to say that not just humans are conscious or that only</p>
<p>human consciousness is eternal. All things that manifest</p>
<p>birth, growth, maintenance, reproduction, dwindling and</p>
<p>death, regardless of higher birth (human) ot lower birth</p>
<p>(animal), are known as eternal beings transmigtating in</p>
<p>the material world. Thus, one who is friendly, kind and</p>
<p>compassionate must be so to all forms of life. It is not that</p>
<p>humans ate spared but animals and others can be killed</p>
<p>ot exploited for our pleasure. This idea falls short of the</p>
<p>vision of Bhagavad-gita which sees all living beings as part</p>
<p>and patcel of the Supreme Person, Krsna. Thus, all living</p>
<p>beings have a right to life.</p>

<p>VERSE 32</p>
<p>अनादित्वाननिगणत्वात्परमात्मायमव्ययः |</p>
<p>डरीरस्थोऽपि कोन्तेय न करोति न छिप्यते ॥६२॥</p>
<p>anaditvan nirgunatvat paramatmayam avyayab</p>
<p>Sartra-stho’pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>O Son of Kunti, the Super Consciousness has no begin-</p>
<p>ning, He is transcendental to the modes of nature and He</p>
