<p>VERSE 21</p>
<p>यद्यदाचरति श्रष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः ।</p>
<p>स यत्ममाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवतंते ॥२९॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>yad yad acarati Sresthas tat tad evetaro janab</p>
<p>sa yat pramanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate</p>
<p></p>
<p>However a great man conducts himself, common men will</p>
<p>follow. Accordingly, whatever standards he sets by his</p>
<p>actions, others will follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Vedic system of political and spiritual leadership is</p>
<p>that one should lead by example. Unfortunately, in today’s</p>
<p>world, good leaders of any kind ate hard to come by. Not</p>
<p>only are we disappointed to learn that those we have elected</p>
<p>to public office are often pilfering the wealth of the coun-</p>
<p>try for their own benefit, but we are even more shocked to</p>
<p>learn that many of out so-called spiritual leaders cannot</p>
<p>even maintain the most basic principles of morality and</p>
<p>engage in abominable, depraved practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sti Krsna states in the above verse that what a great man</p>
<p>does the common man will follow. This is most evident</p>
<p>when we observe how movie stats, rock stars, and sports</p>
<p>personalities influence the majority of people today. That</p>
<p>we tend to be influenced by othets is a human character-</p>
<p>istic, therefore role models are essential. But what human</p>
<p>society needs are role models that are knowledgeable, cal-</p>
<p></p>
<p>tured, morally principled and spiritually advanced.</p>
