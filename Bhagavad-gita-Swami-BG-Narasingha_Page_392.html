<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>have is that which we see all around us — that life comes</p>
<p>from life. We also see that life is intelligently designed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the rational conclusion should be that all life</p>
<p>atises from an intelligent life source. Everything comes</p>
<p></p>
<p>from Krsna.</p>

<p>The Supreme is He from whom the creation, sus-</p>
<p>tenance and annihilation of the manifested universe</p>
<p>arises. (Vedanta-sittra 1.1.2)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna also says that He is situated in the hearts of all</p>
<p>living beings as the Paramatma and from Him all remem-</p>
<p>brance, knowledge and forgetfulness arises. He says itis He</p>
<p>alone who is to be known through the Vedas. He reveals</p>
<p>the Vedanta, the end of knowledge, and it is He who is the</p>
<p>knower of the Vedas. This is also confirmed in the Hari-</p>
<p></p>
<p>varinsa as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>vede ramayane caiva purane bbarate tatha</p>
<p>adav-cante ca madbye ca barih sarvatra gtyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the beginning, the middle and the end, all the</p>
<p>Vedas, the Ramayana, the Puranas and the Mabab-</p>
<p>barata only glorify Krsna. (Hari-varnsa 3.132.35)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Vedas ate divided into four main divisions — Rg,</p>
<p>Yajur, Sama and Atharva Vedas. Then comes the Upantsads</p>
<p>and supplementary literature such as the eighteen Puranas</p>
<p>Gneluding the Srimad Bhagavatam), Mababbarata (Bhaga-</p>
<p>vad-gita), Ramayana and Vedanta-siitra. In all these it is</p>
<p>Hari (Sei Krsna) who 15 to be known.</p>
