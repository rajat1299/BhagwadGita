<p>VERSE 13</p>
<p>तरिभिगुणमयैभविरेभिः सर्वमिदं जगत्‌ |</p>
<p>मोहितं नाभिजानाति मामेभ्यः परमव्ययम्‌ ॥ १६॥</p>

<p>The whole world is bewildered by these three modes of</p>
<p>nature. Thus, no one can understand Me because I am</p>
<p>superior to these modes and unchanging.</p>

<p>Since the most ancient times we find the same funda-</p>
<p>mental questions in the search for knowledge and meaning</p>
<p>— Who are we? Where did we come from? Why ate we</p>
<p>here? How should we conduct ourselves? Is there life after</p>
<p>death? These were questions in the minds of our ancestors</p>
<p>and we still ask the same questions today. The search for</p>
<p>answers to these questions leads an intelligent person to</p>
<p>conclude that consciousness is superior to matter and that</p>
<p>there must be one absolute source from which everything</p>
<p>in the universe and beyond emanates.</p>
<p>Here Sti Krsna says that He is the singular cause of</p>
<p>everything and that nothing is superior to Him. He is</p>
<p></p>
<p>the sum total of the universe and of all living creatures,</p>
<p>but He Himself remains separate from everything as the</p>
<p>Supreme Individual.</p>

<p>Throughout the yoga systems we find that the chant-</p>
<p>ing of mantras is highly recommended and possibly no</p>
<p>mantra is chanted more than om, ot oritk@ra. This oritk@ra is</p>
<p>described as the supreme combination of letters (a, u and</p>
<p></p>
<p>tit) and is thus the primary Vedic mantra. Here Sti Krsna</p>
