<p>ment of the individual. In other words, if people were to</p>
<p>cultivate the qualities that Sti Krsna has mentioned here,</p>
<p>the world would be a far better place. As it is now, the</p>
<p>world is no place for a gentleman. Being devoid of hatred,</p>
<p>being friendly and compassionate to all living beings, being</p>
<p>devoid of any sense of ‘possessiveness, free from egotism,</p>
<p>objective in all circumstances, forgiving, self-controlled,</p>
<p>and being of strong determination etc. are indeed noble</p>
<p>qualities. But how ate people to develop them?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Independently these qualities, and other desirable qual-</p>
<p>ities of the human being mentioned throughout Bhaga-</p>
<p>vad-gita are difficult to develop. It is seen that sometimes a</p>
<p>person may possess one, two ot three of such qualities, but</p>
<p>where is that person who has all these qualities?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna gives the answer in Bhagavad-gita — become a</p>
<p>bhakti-yogi, take shelter of Krsna and surrender everything</p>
<p>to Him. The a#ma is naturally complete with all good</p>
<p>qualities as could ever be desired by a human being. When</p>
<p>one’s mind, intelligence, and consciousness ate purified</p>
<p>by being in association with Krsna through the process</p>
<p>of bhakti-yoga, all desirable qualities develo 12. Therefore,</p>
<p>the open secret to life is that everyone should become a</p>
<p>yogi in bhakti~yoga. Then the world would become a much</p>
<p>better place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Above all good qualities is the quality of devotion to</p>
<p>the Supreme Petson, from which all other good qualities</p>
<p>manifest in great abundance. One does not become dear to</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna simply by independently developing good qualities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All sach qualities must be dovetailed with the quality of</p>
<p></p>
<p>devotion. One who approaches life in that way is a true</p>
<p></p>
<p>bhakti-yogi and is very dear to Krsna.</p>
