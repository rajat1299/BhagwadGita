<p>Knowing this, a yogi surpasses all kinds of pious results</p>
<p></p>
<p>that are achieved. through study of the Vedas, by offering</p>
<p>oblations in sactifice, by penances and by philanthropy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That yogi reaches the eternal abode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>To attain higher planets within the material universe</p>
<p>one must study the Vedas, offer sacrifice, perform pen-</p>
<p>ances and acts of charity. One who has performed these</p>
<p>activities is reborn on a higher planet and lives a long life,</p>
<p>enjoying great luxury for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, the bhakti-yogi has no desire to enjoy in</p>
<p>higher planets. He easily achieves all the benefits of sacri-</p>
<p>fice, penance etc. simply by surrendering to Sa Krsna. The</p>
<p>bhakti-yogi does not have to choose an auspicious moment</p>
<p>to leave the material body because he is under the shelter of</p>
<p>Krsna. Everything is auspiciously ordained for those who</p>
<p>have surrendered to Krsna, enabling them to teach Krsna’s</p>
<p>eternal abode.</p>
<p>But the yog? who is not in bhakti-yoga does not achieve</p>
<p>the Supreme Abode of Krsna nor does he easily ascend to</p>
<p></p>
<p>higher planets at the time of death. Factuall y speaking, the</p>
<p>yogi has to choose the time of his death, so as to pass from</p>
<p>the body at the most opportune time. He must choose</p>
<p>wisely, otherwise he is born again on this Earth. Needless</p>
<p>to say, this is a near impossibility -- especially for ordinary</p>
<p>people. Therefore, it is the yogi in bhakti-yoga that is most</p>
<p></p>
<p>assured of Success.</p>
