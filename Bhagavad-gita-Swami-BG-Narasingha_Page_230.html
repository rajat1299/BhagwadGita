<p>Sti Kysna’s answers to Arjuna ate to the point and if one</p>
<p>accepts Krsna as the ultimate authority in yoga, as indeed</p>
<p>He is, then one quickly attains the most valuable knowl-</p>
<p>edge. To acquire perfect knowledge by speculation or by</p>
<p>the process of trial and error simply wastes valuable time.</p>
<p>In fact, so much time is wasted in speculation and exper-</p>
<p>imentation that even after centuties such processes have</p>
<p>failed to deliver perfect knowledge of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Everyone is dying, and for the most part dying without</p>
<p>answers to life’s most basic questions. However, since time</p>
<p>immemorial, Sti Krsna has had the answers and they are</p>
<p>presented here in Bhagavad -gita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna says that all living beings ate Brahman — part and</p>
<p></p>
<p>parcel of the spiritual energy of the Absolute Trath — eter-</p>
<p>nal, individual, imperishable and immutable. However, in</p>
<p>this material world death of the body comes to everyone.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions. But for those whose mind and</p>
<p>intelligence are fixed on Krsna, they do not take birth</p>
<p>again in the material world, but attain Krsna’s own divine</p>
<p>nature. Krsna is by nature sac-cid-ananda — eternal, com-</p>
<p>plete in knowledge and full of bliss. Remembering Krsna</p>
<p>at the time of death, one attains that nature and is imme-</p>
<p>diately transferred to the abode of Krsna, far beyond the</p>
<p>material sky and the planets of bitth and death. As Krsna</p>
<p>will explain in Chapter 15, one who attains His Supreme</p>
<p>Abode does not return to this material world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we speak of sarisa@ra, we are indeed talking about</p>
<p>reincarnation. Although reincarnation is becoming a pop-</p>
<p>ular belief in many communities, it is for the most part</p>
<p></p>
<p>misunderstood. To many, reincarnation means being born</p>
