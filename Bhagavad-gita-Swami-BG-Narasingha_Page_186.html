<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>practice of astariga~yoga, raja—yoga, batha~yoga and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Kali-yuga the recommended process is bhak-</p>
<p>ti-yoga and meditation is performed through the chanting</p>
<p></p>
<p>of the maba-mantra.</p>
<p></p>
<p>hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare bare</p>
<p></p>
<p>bare rama bare rama rama rama bare bare</p>
<p></p>
<p>The chanting of the maba-4nantra is so powerful and</p>
<p>purifying that, wherever it is chanted, it makes that place</p>
<p>patified. Thus the bbakti-yoga process can be practiced</p>
<p>everywhere and anywhere. Bhakti-yoga is actually the only</p>
<p>recommended process of yoga in Kali-yaga.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The yog? must always strive for self-satisfaction, knowl-</p>
<p>edge and realisation. Such a yogi will always see everything</p>
<p>in this world with equal vision and therefore will not</p>
<p>become attached to anything of a temporaty nature. Krsna</p>
<p>says that the yog? sees gold and mete stones as the same.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the yogi cannot distinguish the bril-</p>
<p>liance of gold from that of ordinary objects; this means</p>
<p>that the yog? is not attracted to finding satisfaction in the</p>
<p>accumulation of wealth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt has been said that the desire for wealth is what makes</p>
<p>the world go round. This may be true in the sense that the</p>
<p>desire for wealth is what drives most people to act. Sadly</p>
<p>we also see cleatly where greed for wealth is taking the</p>
<p>world today — political unrest culminating in war, death</p>
<p></p>
<p>and destruction, economic instability and collapse as well</p>
<p>as extreme instability in the environment. This results in</p>
<p></p>
<p>natutal disasters and the extinction of many species of life.</p>
