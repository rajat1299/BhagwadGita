<p>अ CHAPTER 1 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peace, on the other hand, is rather elusive. Peace is</p>
<p>talked about and even prayed for, bat seldom makes more</p>
<p>than a momentaty appearance. Most of out lives, even for</p>
<p>the humblest of souls, are spent struggling for existence</p>
<p>either socially, politically, financially, mentally or physi-</p>
<p>cally. For most of us the temporary absence of any major</p>
<p>crisis is what we would call peace. However, peace (or Santi</p>
<p>as it is known amongst yogis) 15 a state of consciousness</p>
<p>and not a condition relative to the external affairs of the</p>
<p>material world. Peace is an internal experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The wisdom of the Vedic literature, Srimad Bhagavatam</p>
<p>says, jivo—jivasya-jivanam — one living being is food for</p>
<p></p>
<p>another living being. From the minutest forms of life</p>
<p>to the most complex, one life is sustained by the loss of</p>
<p>another. Thus, the basic ptinciple for material existence is</p>
<p>fundamentally flawed with violence. Peace then, for most</p>
<p>of us, comes in doing what we have to do and believing</p>
<p>that we have done the right thing. Therein lies the fine line</p>
<p>between war and peace. Is what we think to be good, or</p>
<p>what we are conditioned to believe, actually right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ability to disctiminate between right and wrong, or</p>
<p>in some cases good and evil, largely depends on the extent</p>
<p>of knowledge from which we draw out conclusions. A poor</p>
<p></p>
<p>fund of knowledge naturally results in faulty conclusions.</p>
<p>Therefote, it is in our best interest to seek out the greatest</p>
<p>source of knowledge — knowledge of the Absolute Truth,</p>
<p>and familiarise ourselves with that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita is perhaps the most widely read book</p>
<p>of theistic knowledge in the world. Whatever knowledge</p>
<p>one finds in similar books such as the Dhammapada, the</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bible, the Torah, the Koran ete. is also found in the Bhaga~</p>
