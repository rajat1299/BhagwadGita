<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>Atheism is certainly not a new phenomena as there have</p>
<p>always been such thinkers since ancient times. Yet atheism</p>
<p>in modern times seems driven more as a reaction to fanat-</p>
<p>ical religious dogma than by rational argument. Indeed,</p>
<p>often times the arguments of the atheist are as irrational as</p>
<p>those of religious fanatics. When presented with an intel-</p>
<p>ligent proposal, a rationalist should be wi ing to accept</p>
<p>it, regardless of where that proposal leads, even if it leads</p>
<p>to undermine his atheistic world view. Such would be the</p>
<p>mentality of a real seeker of truth or science.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the most part, in the modern arena of debate between</p>
<p>theists and atheists, the student of Bhagavad-gita would not</p>
<p>side with either because both are predominately ignorant of</p>
<p></p>
<p>higher knowledge. Coming in contact with Bhagavad-gita,</p>
<p></p>
<p>both the atheists and religious fanatics are silenced because</p>
<p>within the Gira lies the most definitive knowledge of the</p>
<p>Absolute Trath ever revealed to the world.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering, Iam</p>
<p>the sacred herbs, I am the mantra and I am the clarified</p>
<p>butter, I am the sacred fire and I am the act of offering.</p>
