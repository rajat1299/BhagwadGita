<p>Under My command, material nature produces the uni-</p>
<p>verse with all its moving and non-moving beings. O son of</p>
<p>Kunti, because of this the universe continually manifests.</p>

<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Evetyone acts in the material world and everyone is</p>
<p>held responsible for their actions by the laws of material</p>
<p>nature ot the laws of karma. Newton's Third Law of Phys-</p>
<p>ics states that for every action there is an equal and oppo-</p>
<p>site reaction. At a glance this sounds like a good definition</p>
<p>of karma, but karma is much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>The saying, ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’</p>
<p>also does not accurately define the laws of action and reac-</p>
<p>tion. Karma is far more intricate and complicated than a</p>
<p>simple one on one analogy can provide. Suffice to say that</p>
<p>when one performs an action he is held responsible and</p>
<p>thus liable for the reaction, whatever that may be. Material</p>
<p>nature may therefore be considered superior to the energy</p>
<p>of the living beings, in that the living beings have no con-</p>
<p></p>
<p>trol over material nature. People are expett in exploiting</p>
