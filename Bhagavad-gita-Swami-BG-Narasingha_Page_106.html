<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>occurred, It can only be concluded that the aryan people</p>
<p>and Vedic knowledge were always indigenous to India.</p>
<p>The Vedic knowledge is that Visnu/Krsna is Supreme</p>
<p>and the lesser gods and goddesses such as Brahma, Siva,</p>
<p>Ganeéa, Kartikeya, Kali and Sarasvati ete. are actually setv-</p>
<p>ants of the Supreme Being and are empowered with the</p>
<p>duties of managing the universal affairs of material nature.</p>
<p>In the above verses Sti Krsna recommends that offerings</p>
<p>should be made to the demigods and thus the demigods</p>
<p>will be pleased to bestow unto humanity all the necessities</p>
<p>of life. This is, in short, a universal law of taxation. In</p>
<p></p>
<p>other words, we must give the demigods theit dues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt is also intrinsic to the nature of the Za, to perform</p>
<p>service and sacrifice. Constitutionally the amma, being part</p>
<p>of the organic whole (the Absolute Truth), is duty-bound</p>
<p>to serve the whole, both in this life and in eternity. When</p>
<p>sactifice or offerings ate made to Visna such as fruits, veg-</p>
<p>etables etc. then one’s senses become purified by eating the</p>
<p>remnants of such offerings. But if one takes the things of</p>
<p>this world without first acknowled. ging to whom they actu-</p>
<p>ally belong, then one simp. Ly incuts a karmic reaction. This</p>
<p>also includes our daily food that should fitst be offered</p>
<p>to Visnu/Krsna. It will be explained by Sti Krsna later in</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita that these food offerings should comprise</p>
<p>of vegetables, 015, milk products, flowers etc. Non-veg-</p>
<p>etarian food items cannot be offered to Visnu or Krsna —</p>
<p>consequently the servants of Visnu/Krsna are vegetarian.</p>
<p>Kysna will also explain that those who serve the Absolute</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trath are not duty-bound to serve the demigods, nor are</p>
<p>they bound by any other social consideration.</p>
