<p>अ CHAPTER 6 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 47</p>
<p>योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्रतेनान्तरात्मना ।</p>
<p>श्रद्धावान्भजते यो मां स मे युक्ततमो मतः ॥४७॥</p>
<p>करदा api sarvesath mad gatenantaratmana</p>
<p>Sraddbavan bhajate yo math sa me yuktatamo matab</p>
<p></p>
<p>I consider the best of all yogis to be the bhakti-yogi who</p>
<p>abides in Me, who meditates upon Me and who worships</p>
<p>Me with firm faith.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Axjuna’s questions in verses 37 and 38 are very critical for</p>
<p>our understanding. Arjuna wants to know what happens to</p>
<p>one who practices yoga for sometime, but for some reason or</p>
<p>another, does not become completely self-realised and gives</p>
<p>up the body at death without having attained perfection.</p>
<p>What is the destination of such a person in the next life?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first thing to note here is that Arjuna is aware or</p>
<p>completely convinced that this one life is not the all-in-all.</p>
<p>As Sti Kysna has said previously, we have had many lives</p>
<p>in the past and we will have many in the future. Therefore</p>
<p>Atjuna wants to know of his fate or that of anyone who</p>
<p>practices yoga but does not reach perfection. What will be</p>
<p>the fate of such a person in the next life?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna’s reply is that of the all-knowing, omniscient</p>
<p>Supreme Being. Krsna says that for the yogi there is never</p>
<p>any loss. If one does not achieve perfection in this life</p>
<p>then in the next life one will be born in favourable cir-</p>
<p>cumstances and begin the process anew. In the next life,</p>
<p>one will again become attracted to the practice of yoga</p>
<p></p>
<p>and continue on the path. Even if it takes many lifetimes,</p>
<p></p>
