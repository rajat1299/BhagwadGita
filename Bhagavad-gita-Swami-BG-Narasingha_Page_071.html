<p>अ CHAPTER2 Aye</p>
<p></p>
<p>eso’nur atma cetasa veditavyo</p>
<p>yasmin pranab pattcadba sarivivesa</p>
<p>pranai§ cittarh sarvam otam prajanam</p>
<p>yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty-esa atma</p>
<p></p>
<p>The atma is atomic in size and can be perceived</p>
<p>by perfect intelligence. This atomic atma is floating</p>
<p>in the five kinds of aits, is situated in the heart,</p>
<p>and spreads its influence all over the body of the</p>
<p>embodied living beings. When the atma is purified</p>
<p>from its contamination of the five kinds of material</p>
<p>aits, its spiritual influence is exhibited. (Mundaka</p>
<p></p>
<p>Upanisad 3.1.9)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The cycle of bitth and death (sarisara) is described as</p>
<p></p>
<p>anatutal phenomenon for one who is embodied. Although</p>
<p></p>
<p>such a conception may be considered a fatalistic world</p>
<p>view, both bitth and death are an unwanted experience for</p>
<p>the embodied consciousness. After experiencing life, no</p>
<p>sane petson wants to die — everyone has the desire to live</p>
<p>as long as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To that end, nowad, ays the producers of wonder drugs</p>
<p>promise us eternal life, although no such life-giving cures</p>
<p>exist at ptesent — everyone has to die and before death</p>
<p>comes, the wonder drugs and doctors fees are sure to bank-</p>
<p>rapt the family fortune. However, death is an unnataral</p>
<p>experience. The fact that everyone seeks everlasting life</p>
<p>should be indicative that such a pure state of life exists</p>
<p>beyond bitth and death. Indeed it does and Sti Krsna will</p>
<p>shed light on that subject as this chapter develops.</p>
