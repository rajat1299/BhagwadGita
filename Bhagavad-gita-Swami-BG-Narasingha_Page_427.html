<p>Bye CHAPTER 17 व</p>
<p></p>
<p>Austerities that are performed with pride in order to</p>
<p>achieve prestige, name and fame are said to be in the mode</p>
<p>of passion. The results of such austerities are unstable</p>
<p></p>
<p>and temporary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 19</p>
<p>मूढग्राहेणात्मनो यत्पीडया क्रियते तपः |</p>
<p>परस्योत्सादनार्थ वा तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्‌ ॥ ९९॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>11 11110111.</p>
<p>parasyotsadanartharh va tat tamasam udabrtam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Austerities performed out of foolishness that inflict pain on</p>
<p>oneself and others, are said to be in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvttti</p>
<p></p>
<p>Austerity is called tapasya, or the undertaking of some</p>
<p>measure of practice that diminishes material activities and</p>
<p>promotes a conscious awareness of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>These austerities are described in verses 14, [5 and 16.</p>
<p>Physical austerities are described as maintaining purity</p>
<p>(cleanliness), sincerity, celibacy and non-violence. Celibacy</p>
<p>means not to engage in acts of illicit sex (sex outside of</p>
<p>mattiage). Physical austerity also includes the worship of</p>
<p>the Supreme Person and honouring the gura and saintly</p>
<p>persons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Austerities that are performed out of pride and for the</p>
<p>purpose of prestige, name and fame are to be rejected. This</p>
<p>may also include fasting for political, social or economic</p>
<p>advantages. Austerities performed out of foolishness that</p>
<p>cause pain and suffering should also be rejected. All such</p>
<p></p>
<p>austerities are thus abandoned because they are performed</p>
