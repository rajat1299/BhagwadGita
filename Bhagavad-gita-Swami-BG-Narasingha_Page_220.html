<p>and are fixed in devotion to Krsna. They completely</p>
<p>control the six bad qualities — lust, anget, greed and</p>
<p>so forth. They eat only as much as required, and</p>
<p>they are not intoxicated with false ego. They are</p>
<p>respectful, gtave, compassionate and without false</p>
<p>prestige. They are friendly, poetic, expert and silent.</p>
<p>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Madbya-Iila, 22. 78-80)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The popularity of the bhakti movement in contempo-</p>
<p>raty times has also come to include the worship of many</p>
<p>demigods and demigoddesses such as Siva, Ganega, Sar-</p>
<p>asvati, Laksmi etc. However, according to Bhagavad-gita,</p>
<p>the worship of various demigods is not on the same level</p>
<p>as worshipping Kysna and thus does not help one advance</p>
<p>in self-realisation. Bhakti-yoga is solely meant for Krsna.</p>
<p>Bhakti is the reciprocal exchange between Krsna and His</p>
<p>devotees and thus bhakti is incompatible with the worship</p>
<p>of the demigods.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tt is not that the demigods are ‘false gods,’ bat they</p>
<p>simply cannot free one from material bondage. Krsna</p>
<p>knows what is necessary for the ultimate good of all living</p>
<p>creatures and therefore He says that worship of demigods</p>
<p>is less intelligent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It can also be said that those who worship the demi-</p>
<p>gods worship Krsna indirectly, because the demigods are</p>
<p>the representatives of Krsna for the management of uni-</p>
<p>versal affairs. In that way the worship of demigods is also</p>
<p></p>
<p>the worship of Krsna, save and except for the fruits of</p>
<p></p>
<p>liberation. Only Krsna is known as mukti-pada, the giver</p>
<p>of liberation, or Mukunda. Speaking in Padma Purana,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Siva says:</p>
