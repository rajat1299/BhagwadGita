<p>Byam CHAPTER 13 व्य</p>
<p></p>
<p>tion, we come within the factor of time, space and</p>
<p>thought. And when we come to exploit, action and</p>
<p>reaction begins in the negative land of loan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the jivatma, by exercise of bis free will and out</p>
<p>of curiosity, first enters into this land — from then be</p>
<p>becomes a factor of this limited world. But his partic-</p>
<p>ipation is beyond the beginning of this limited world.</p>
<p>That ts why it is said to be anadi. Anadi means that</p>
<p>it does not come from within the jurisdiction of this</p>
<p>limited world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once subject to contact with material nature, the living</p>
<p>beings ate then subject to karma, the laws of action and</p>
<p>reaction. Under these laws the living beings enjoy and suffer</p>
<p>in various species of life. Dating their material sojourn,</p>
<p>the Paramatma accompanies the living beings and is ever</p>
<p>watchful for when they will turn their head towards the</p>
<p>Absolute Truth. The Paramatma directs the wanderings of</p>
<p>the living beings, and when one desires to know the Trath,</p>
<p>the Paramatma manifests before the living beings as the</p>
<p>spititual master who teaches Bhagavad-gita as it is. Hence</p>
<p></p>
<p>the living being transcends the world of birth and death.</p>

<p></p>
<p>According to their karma, the jivatmas are wandering</p>
<p>throughout the universe. Some jivatmas who are most</p>
<p>fortunate receive the mercy of guru and Krsna, and</p>
<p>by such mercy they receive the seed of the creeper of</p>
<p>devotion. (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madbya-lila 19.151)</p>
