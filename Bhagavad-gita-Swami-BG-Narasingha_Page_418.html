<p>the Far East, ancestor worship is very popular amongst the</p>
<p>Buddhists, Shintoists and Taoists. Similarly, in Europe and</p>
<p>America, great monuments are erected to revere scientists,</p>
<p>politicians, soldiers, movie stats, rock stars etc. In Aftica,</p>
<p>Tibet, Mexico and South America, the worship of ghosts</p>
<p>and spirits is popular. All these forms of worship are con-</p>
<p>ducted in the three modes of matetial nature. Therefore,</p>
<p>having rejected the Vedas, it is to be concluded that the</p>
<p>worshippers of demigods, ancestors, famous persona ities,</p>
<p>ghosts and spirits ate not transcendentally situated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To be transcendental to material nature means to</p>
<p>accept the Vedas and thus be situated beyond the modes</p>
<p></p>
<p>of nature in the realm of visuddha-sattva, pure goodness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When one’s faith is situated in pure goodness, one wot-</p>
<p></p>
<p>ships the Supreme Person, Krsna. This is the highest stage</p>
<p>of monotheism — the acceptance of one Supreme Being.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pute-goodness is described by Siva as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>sattvarh visuddham vasudeva-Sabditarh</p>
<p>yad tyate tatra puman apavrtab</p>
<p>sattve ca tasmin bhagavan vasudevo</p>
<p>by adboksajo me namasa vidhiyate</p>
<p></p>
<p>One should always worship Krsna in pure goodness.</p>
<p>Pure goodness is always pure consciousness in which</p>
<p>the Absolute Truth, known as Vasudeva, is revealed</p>
<p>without any covering. (Srimad Bhagavatam 4.3.23)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the stage of pure consciousness, one is guided by</p>
<p>the highest type of faith called nirguna-Sraddba, transcen-</p>
<p>dental faith that is uncontaminated by the modes of mate-</p>
<p>tial nature. After many lifetimes of following the Vedas</p>
