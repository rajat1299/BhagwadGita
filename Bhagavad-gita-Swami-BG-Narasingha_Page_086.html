<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>

<p>tani sarvant sarhyamya yukta asita mat-parab</p>
<p>vase bi yasyendriyani tasya prajita pratisthita</p>
<p></p>
<p>Restraining all the senses, a self-controlled person should</p>
<p>fix his mind upon Me. Thus he becomes firmly situated in</p>
<p>divine knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anuvrttt</p>
<p></p>
<p>As previously stated, there are numerous yoga systems.</p>
<p>Sti Krsna states unequivocally that by the system of with-</p>
<p>drawing one’s senses from the objects of the senses, namely</p>
<p>sound, touch, taste, smell and sight for sense satisfaction</p>
<p>and concentrating the mind on Him, one becomes firmly</p>
<p>situated in divine knowledge and samadhi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Simply suspending the senses without positive engage-</p>
<p>ment for advancing in spiritual life is not very profitable.</p>
<p>Many yogis have tried giving up sense activities altogether,</p>
<p>bat because the taste, or attachment, for sense-objects</p>
<p>remains, many have fallen down in their attempts. How-</p>
<p>ever, the senses of the bhakti-yog? who follows Krsna’s</p>
<p>direction are safeguarded because the senses are engaged</p>
<p>twenty-fours hours a day in Krsna’s service. As such, the</p>
<p>taste for sensual satisfaction gradually dries up and disap-</p>
<p>pears leaving the bhakti-yogi free to advance spiritually.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One who cannot control the senses cannot concentrate</p>
<p>the mind. Additionally, the senses are never actually satis—</p>
<p>fied by materia engagement. The senses become satiated</p>
<p>for sometime, but then again become stimulated with an</p>
<p>even greater avarice. Those who are servants of the bodily</p>
<p></p>
<p>senses can never become masters of the self.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being fully absorbed in pure spiritual consciousness or</p>
<p>samadhi means to be conscious of Krsna as the Supreme</p>
