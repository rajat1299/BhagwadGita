<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>simply an intoxicant, as some readets of the Bhagavad-gita</p>
<p>have surmised. Only those fully conversant in the three</p>
<p>Vedas who were expert in performing Vedic rituals were</p>
<p>allowed to drink soma. Due to the passage of time, we do</p>
<p>not know exactly how soma Was made, but we do know</p>
<p>that it was an elixir and not simply an intoxicant like wine,</p>
<p>whisky or gafija.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who are conversant in the Vedas reach the higher</p>
<p>planets and enjoy celestial pleasures. Krsna says that when</p>
<p>their pious credit is exhausted, they again enter the mortal</p>
<p>plane of Earth. Therefore, the understanding is that all</p>
<p>endeavours for material pleasure are temporary, even those</p>
<p>experienced in higher planets.</p>
<p>But for the bhakti-yogi there is no need to perform com-</p>
<p>plicated and costly Vedic rituals because all the purposes</p>
<p>of such ceremonies are fulfilled by acts of devotion and</p>
<p>surrender to Krsna. The intimacy of the bbakti-yogis with</p>
<p></p>
<p>Krsna is such that He proclaims that He carries what they</p>
<p></p>
<p>ack and preserves what they have. This is the extension of</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kysna’s shelter (asraya), for those who sutrender to Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This theme is repeated throughout the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VERSE 24</p>
<p>अहं हि सर्वयज्ञानां भोक्ता च प्रभुरेव च ।</p>
<p>न तु मामभिजानन्ति तत्त्वेनातश्चयवन्ति ते ॥२४॥</p>
<p></p>
<p>abath bi sarva-yajhtanarh 00०61 ca prabbureva ca</p>
<p>na tu mam abbijananti tattvenatas cyavanti te</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is I who am the enjoyer and. object of all sacrifices. But</p>
<p>those who are ignorant of My true nature fall down from</p>
<p>the path of self-realisation.</p>
