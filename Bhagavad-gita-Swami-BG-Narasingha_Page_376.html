<p>ग BHAGAVAD-GITA oye</p>
<p></p>
<p>of knowledge relies completely on the mind, intelligence</p>
<p>and senses and is thus subject to the four material defects</p>
<p>of mistakes, illusion, cheating and false perception.</p>
<p>Accordingly, no scientific knowledge is perfect, nor can</p>
<p>it be perfect. Truly, by the admission of many scientists,</p>
<p>they never really attain the end of knowledge. The more</p>
<p>they learn, the more there is to learn, or the more they</p>
<p>learn, the more they discover that their predecessors were</p>
<p>wrong. In any case, scientists admit that they do not have</p>
<p>perfect knowledge — death comes and another generation</p>
<p>of scientists is reduced to dust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Knowledge that is descending from Sti Krsna and</p>
<p>through the guru-disciple parampara is known as avaroha-</p>
<p>pantha and is free from material defects. Bhagavad-gita</p>
<p>means the words of Sti Krsna — hearing which enables one</p>
<p>to achieve the perfection of life before death comes.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Arjuna inquired: O Krsna, by what symptoms can one who</p>
<p>has transcended these three modes be known? How does he</p>
<p>act and how does he transcend these three modes?</p>
